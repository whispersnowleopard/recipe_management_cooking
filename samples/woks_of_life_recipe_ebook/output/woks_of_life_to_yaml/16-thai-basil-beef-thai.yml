title: THAI BASIL BEEF Thai
description: basil beef is another quick Thai-inspired dish that only takes minutes
  to make. Try it once, and you’ll swear it’s better than takeout. This dish is traditionally
  made with holy basil, which is rarely available in American or even most Asian grocery
  stores. If you can’t find holy basil, you may be able to find regular Thai basil.
  That said, you can substitute regular Italian basil in a pinch! You won’t get quite
  the same flavor, but you’ll be in the same ballpark at least. If you have a green
  thumb, try growing holy basil in your garden––like most types of basil, it’s very
  easy to grow during the summer months. See this recipe on the blog.
