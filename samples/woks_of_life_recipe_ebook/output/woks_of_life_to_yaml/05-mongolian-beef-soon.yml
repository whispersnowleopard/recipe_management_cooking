title: MONGOLIAN BEEF Soon
description: after it was published on the blog, this Mongolian Beef quickly rose
  to become one of our most popular recipes. While it’s definitely not Mongolian (chalk
  it up to the American restauranteurs, menu planners, and marketers who probably
  gave the dish its name), it doesn’t take a genius to know that despite their somewhat
  misleading names, these Chinese-American dishes can be GOOD! Our version is a crispy,
  flavorful homemade version that’s less sweet than the gloopy restaurant version
  you might be used to. See this recipe on the blog. Marinate the beef for 1 hour
  in 1 teaspoon oil, 1 teaspoon soy sauce, and 1 tablespoon cornstarch. Once marinated,
  dredge the meat in the remaining 1/4 cup of cornstarch until lightly coated.

ingredients:
- 8 ounces flank steak, sliced
- against the grain into 1/4-inch thick slices
- 1 teaspoon vegetable oil, plus 1/3 cup for frying
- 1 teaspoon low sodium soy
- sauce, plus 1/4 cup
- 1 tablespoon plus 1/4 cup cornstarch
- 1/2 teaspoon minced ginger
- 5 dried red chili peppers (optional)
- 2 cloves garlic, chopped
- 1/4 cup water or low sodium chicken stock
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- Cornstarch slurry (1 tablespoon
- cornstarch mixed with 1 tablespoon water)
- 2 scallions, cut into 1-inch
- long slices on the diagonal
directions: Heat 1/3 cup vegetable oil in the wok over high heat. Just before the
  oil starts to smoke, spread the flank steak pieces evenly in the wok, and let sear
  for 1 minute (depending upon the heat of your wok). Turn over and let the other
  side sear for another 30 seconds. Remove to a sheet pan; tilt it slightly to let
  the oil drain to one side (lean it on a cookbook or cutting board). The beef should
  be seared with a crusty coating. Drain the oil from the wok, leaving 1 tablespoon
  behind, and turn the heat to medium-high. Add the ginger and dried chili peppers,
  if using. After about 15 seconds, add the chopped garlic. Stir for another 10 seconds
  and add the 1/4 cup low sodium soy sauce and chicken stock (or water). Bring the
  sauce to a simmer, add the brown sugar, and stir until dissolved. Let the sauce
  simmer for about 2 minutes and slowly stir in the cornstarch slurry mixture--until
  the sauce coats the back of a spoon. Add the beef and scallions and toss everything
  together for another 30 seconds. There should be almost no liquid, as the sauce
  should be clinging to the beef. If you still have sauce, increase the heat slightly
  and stir until thickened. Plate and serve with steamed rice!
