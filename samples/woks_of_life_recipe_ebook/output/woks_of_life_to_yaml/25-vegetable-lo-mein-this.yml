title: VEGETABLE LO MEIN This
description: vegetable lo mein is a really simple, versatile noodle dish that can
  be a staple vegetarian meal or a go-to meatless Monday dinner. Vegetable lo mein
  is healthy, tasty, and very easy to make. We used fresh eggless hand-pulled noodles,
  but you can feel free to use packaged fresh white noodles or lo mein egg noodles
  from the Asian grocery store. You can even sub in dried spaghetti if you have nothing
  else! This recipe is a blank canvas––you have your noodles and sauce as a base,
  and virtually any vegetables you like as your paint palette. See this recipe on
  the blog. Boil water in a large pot for the noodles. If using the lo mein egg noodles,
  you can skip this step, as those noodles do not require any pre-cooking. But if
  using fresh white noodles, you will have to boil them. Just cook until al dente,
  drain, and rinse in cold water. Set aside.

ingredients:
- 1 pound (450g) fresh white noodles or lo mein egg noodles
- 1 tablespoon dark soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons light soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 1 teaspoon sugar + 1 teaspoon
- hot water to dissolve the sugar in
- pinch of five spice powder (optional)
- 1 tablespoon oil
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 cup sliced mushrooms (shiitakes, button mushrooms, or anything you like)
- 1 scallion, split at the thick parts
- and cut into 2-inch lengths
- 1 red, orange, or yellow bell pepper, julienned
- 1 small carrot, julienned
- 1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine
- a handful snow peas, trimmed
- a handful of leafy greens (bok
- choy, choy sum, etc.)
directions: In a small bowl, combine the soy sauces, sesame oil, dissolved sugar,
  and five spice powder, if using. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a wok over high heat and
  add the garlic, mushrooms, and the white parts of the scallions. Stir-fry for 30
  seconds and add the peppers and carrots. Make sure your wok is searing hot, and
  then add the Shaoxing wine. Stir-fry for another minute. Next, add the snow peas
  and leafy greens to the wok and cook until the greens are just wilted. Then add
  your noodles. Make sure that before you add them, they’re somewhat loose and not
  all clumped together (you can rinse them in warm water to loosen them up before
  adding them to the wok). Pour your sauce mixture over the noodles and stir-fry until
  the color of the noodles are uniform. A folding or scoop-and-lift motion works well
  for that. Once everything is well-combined, dish out the noodles and serve.
