title: CHINESE TAKEOUT FRIED CHICKEN WINGS Chinese
description: take-out fried chicken wings are the same as regular old fried chicken,
  right? Wrong! This wing recipe is special. Bill’s father used to make a tray full
  of them each day at the family restaurant, and while the recipe was never written
  down, he could make them in his sleep if he had to. They were pre-fried in the morning
  and re-fried to order throughout the day, and those mountains would turn into molehills
  real fast during the lunch, dinner and late night rush hours. Once a week, at the
  end of the night, we would toss a few into the fryer and serve them with dinner.
  No matter what we were having, they were always a favorite. See this recipe on the
  blog.

ingredients:
- 10 whole chicken wings, washed and pat dry
- 1/8 teaspoon black pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon white pepper
- ¼ teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon salt ½ teaspoon sugar
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 1 egg
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 2 tablespoons flour oil, for frying
directions: Combine all the ingredients (except the frying oil, of course) in a large
  mixing bowl. Mix everything until the wings are well-coated. Let the wings marinate
  for 2 hours at room temperature or in the refrigerator overnight for best results.
  (If you refrigerate the wings, be sure to let them come to room temperature again
  before cooking). After marinating, if it looks like there is liquid in the wings,
  be sure to mix them thoroughly again. The wings should be well coated with a thin
  batter-like coating. If it still looks too watery, add a bit more cornstarch and
  flour. Fill a medium pot about 2/3 of the way up with oil, and heat it to 325 degrees
  F. Fry the wings in small batches for 5 minutes and remove to a sheet pan lined
  with paper towels. After all of the wings are fried, return them in batches to the
  oil and fry again for 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels or a cooling rack, and serve
  with hot sauce!
