title: ASIAN MILK BREAD There
description: 'are many milk bread recipes on the Internet, and many of them are quite
  complicated. No matter how closely we followed many of these recipes, on other food
  blogs and Chinese recipe sites alike, we were never satisfied with the outcome.
  All along, it turned out our cousin Heidi had the perfect recipe. It was the closest
  in taste and texture to Chinese bakery milk bread and also incredibly easy to make.
  You just have to put everything in the mixer to make the dough, proof for 60 minutes,
  knead the dough again, shape it, proof, and bake. The final product is fluffy, soft,
  slightly sweet, and golden. See this recipe on the blog. In the bowl of a mixer,
  add ingredients in the following order: heavy cream, milk, egg, sugar, cake flour,
  bread flour, yeast, and salt. Use the dough hook attachment, and turn on the mixer
  to “stir.” Let it go for 15 minutes, occasionally stopping the mixer to push the
  dough together. If you’re in a humid climate and the dough is too sticky, feel free
  to add a little more flour ¼ cup at a time until it comes together. If you don’t
  have a mixer and would like to knead by hand, extend the kneading time by 5-10 minutes.
  After 15 minutes of kneading, the dough is ready for proofing. Cover the bowl with
  a damp towel and place in a warm spot for 1 hour. We proof the dough in our oven
  (We turned on our oven’s rapid proof setting for 5 minutes, turned the oven off,
  and then closed the oven door). The dough will grow to 1.5X its original size. In
  the meantime, grease two baking vessels on all sides with butter, such as 2 standard
  loaf pans or even a loaf pan and a 9-inch round cake pan. After the hour of proofing,
  put the dough back in the mixer and stir for another 5 minutes to get rid of air
  bubbles. Dump the dough on a lightly floured surface, and cut it in half. You can
  make a loaf with one half of the dough by cutting it into 3 pieces and placing them
  in the loaf pan. With the other half of the dough, cut it into eight equal pieces
  and make buns. You can really shape the dough however you like––2 loaves, 1 loaf
  and a 1 pan of buns, or even 12-16 individual buns. Once shaped, let the dough proof
  for another hour.'
