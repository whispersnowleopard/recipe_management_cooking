title: EGG FRIED RICE Egg
description: fried rice. Deceptively simple, but a huge favorite and crowd-pleaser.
  Our egg fried rice recipe uses egg that’s slightly flavored with turmeric and paprika,
  which is a unique addition. It adds color to the dish, making it a vibrant yellow.
  If you’re used to a Chinese takeout place that makes their fried rice yellow, you
  can be sure they were probably using food coloring. Using turmeric gets you that
  same color at home with a natural ingredient. Of course, like most fried rice recipes,
  this egg fried rice is best served with copious amounts of chili oil (see recipe
  on page 8 of this eBook). See this recipe on the blog. Use a fork to fluff up the
  rice and break it apart. If you’re using freshly

ingredients:
- 5 cups cooked rice
- 5 large eggs (divided)
- 2 tablespoons water ¼ teaspoon paprika ¼ teaspoon turmeric
- 3 tablespoons oil (divided)
- 1 medium onion, finely chopped
- ½ red bell pepper, finely chopped
- ½ cup frozen peas, thawed
- 1½ teaspoons salt ¼ teaspoon sugar
- ¼ teaspoon black pepper
- 2 scallions, chopped
directions: cooked rice, let it stand on the counter uncovered until it stops steaming
  before fluffing it. If you decide to refrigerate the rice overnight in advance of
  preparing this recipe, it will clump up; you can then use your hands to break up
  the cold rice clumps into individual grains. Beat 3 eggs in one bowl. Beat the other
  2 eggs in another bowl, along with 2 tablespoons water, the paprika, and the turmeric.
  Set these two bowls aside. Heat a wok over medium high heat, and add 2 tablespoons
  oil. Add the 3 beaten eggs (without the spices), and scramble them. Remove them
  from the wok and set aside. Heat wok over high heat, and add the last tablespoon
  oil. Add the diced onion and bell pepper. Stir-fry for 1-2 minutes. Next, add the
  rice and stir-fry for 2 minutes, using a scooping motion to heat the rice uniformly.
  Use your wok spatula to flatten out and break up any rice clumps. Next, pour the
  remaining uncooked egg and spice mixture over the rice, and stir-fry for about 1
  minute, until all of the rice grains are coated in egg. Add the peas and stir fry
  continuously for another minute. Next spread the salt, sugar, and black pepper over
  the rice and mix. You should now see some steam coming off the rice, which means
  it is heated through. If the rice looks a little dry, feel free to sprinkle in some
  water or chicken stock. Adding some liquid directly to any remaining clumps of rice
  will also help to break them up. Stir in the scrambled eggs and scallions. Serve!
