title: SIMPLE WONTON SOUP Traditionally,
description: wontons are very delicate little things, sometimes filled with vegetables
  and usually pork…served in a flavorful chicken soup seasoned with some sesame oil
  and white pepper. There are different types and versions, but for us, this is wonton
  soup in its simplest, purest form. Head to your local Asian grocer for the wonton
  wrappers. You’ll see a couple different kinds, including ones made with white flour,
  and others made with eggs. For this recipe, you’re looking for square shaped wrappers
  that are white. This recipe makes about three dozen, or about four to six servings.
  See this recipe on the blog. Start by thoroughly washing the vegetables. Bring a
  large pot of water to a boil and blanch the vegetables just until wilted. Drain
  and rinse in cold water. Grab a good clump of veg and carefully squeeze out as much
  water as you can. Very finely chop the vegetables (you can also speed up the process
  by throwing them in the food processor).

ingredients:
- 10 oz. baby bok choy or similar green vegetable
- 1 cup ground pork
- 2½ tablespoons sesame oil Pinch white pepper
- 1 tablespoon seasoned soy sauce ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon shaoxing wine
- 1 pack wonton skins
- 6 cups good chicken stock
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- White pepper and salt to taste
- 1 scallion, chopped
directions: In a medium bowl, add the finely chopped vegetables, ground pork, sesame
  oil, white pepper, soy sauce, salt, and shaoxing wine. Mix very thoroughly until
  the mixture is totally emulsified—almost like a paste. Now it’s time to assemble!
  Fill a small bowl with water. Grab a wrapper and use your finger to moisten the
  edges of the wrapper. Add a little over a teaspoon of filling to the middle. Fold
  the wrapper in half and press the two sides together so you get a firm seal. Hold
  the bottom two corners of the little rectangle you just made and bring the two corners
  together. You can use a bit of water to make sure they stick. And that’s it! Keep
  assembling until all the filling is gone. Place the wontons on a baking sheet or
  plate lined with parchment paper to prevent sticking. At this point, you can cover
  the wontons with plastic wrap, put the baking sheet/plate into the freezer, and
  transfer them to Ziploc bags once they’re frozen. They’ll keep for a couple months
  in the freezer, and be ready for wonton soup whenever you want it. To make the soup,
  heat your chicken stock to a simmer and add sesame oil, white pepper, and salt.
  Bring a separate pot of water to a boil. Carefully add the wontons one at a time
  to the pot. Stir to prevent the wontons from sticking to the bottom. If they do
  stick, don’t worry, They should come free once they’re cooked. They’re done when
  they float. Take care not to overcook them. Remove the wontons with a slotted spoon
  and put them in bowls. Pour the soup over the wontons and garnish with chopped scallions.
  Serve!
