title: EGG DROP SOUP The
description: name “Egg Drop” comes from how the soup is made—dropping raw egg into
  hot soup to cook it. It doesn’t take a genius to figure that out. But actually,
  the direct translation in Chinese is “egg flower soup,” because the egg creates
  large and small swirls in the soup in a flower-like pattern. There are many variations
  of egg drop soup, but this recipe is a classic restaurant-style soup that you can
  make at home. See this recipe on the blog.

ingredients:
- 4 cups organic chicken stock or homemade chicken stock
- ½ teaspoon sesame oil ½ teaspoon salt Pinch of sugar Pinch white pepper
- 5 drops yellow food coloring
- (optional, but if you want “the look...”)
- ¼ cup cornstarch mixed with ½ cup water
- 3 eggs, slightly beaten
- 1 scallion, chopped
directions: 'Bring the chicken stock to a simmer in a medium soup pot. Stir in the
  sesame oil, salt, sugar, and white pepper. Add in 5 drops of yellow food coloring,
  if using. The yellow food coloring gives the soup that rich restaurant-style yellow
  color but it is, of course, optional. Taste the soup, and adjust the seasoning if
  needed. Next add the cornstarch slurry; make sure the cornstarch and water is mixed
  well, as the cornstarch settles very quickly. Stir the soup continuously as you
  drizzle in the slurry, or you’ll get unpleasant clumps of cooked starch in your
  soup. Use more or less starch if you like a thicker or thinner soup. You can also
  add the starch in a couple small batches, let the soup simmer for a couple of minutes,
  then check to see if the consistency is to your liking. Now we’re ready for the
  most exciting part: the egg. This recipe calls for the egg to be slightly beaten,
  which results in both white and yellow egg swirls. The speed at which you stir the
  soup when adding the egg also determines whether you get large “egg flowers” or
  small egg flowers (i.e. swirly bits of egg). This is more a matter of personal preference
  than correctness. If you vary the speed at which you stir the soup, you’ll get both.
  Some people even prefer chunks of egg in their soup, so do whatever suits your preferences!
  Once the soup’s consistency is to your liking, use a ladle to stir the soup in a
  circular motion, and slowly drizzle in the egg until you have added it all. Ladle
  the soup in a bowl, top with chopped scallions, drizzle some sesame oil over the
  top, and serve!'
