title: VEGETABLE DUMPLINGS While
description: vegetable dumplings may sound like they’re only for vegetarians or the
  health-conscious, these actually rival any meat-filled dumpling out there. Onions,
  cabbage, and carrot offer sweetness to the filling, while shiitake mushrooms add
  an earthy meatiness and umami. Finally, the addition of Chinese garlic chives gives
  these dumplings that extra kick of flavor (find them in Asian grocery stores). This
  recipe includes instructions on how to make your own dumpling wrappers, but you
  can also just get store-bought circular dumpling wrappers as well. See this recipe
  on the blog. Start by making the dough for the dumpling wrappers (if not using storebought).
  Put 3 1/2 cups flour in a large mixing bowl. Gradually add the water to the flour
  and knead into a smooth dough. This process should take about 10 minutes. Cover
  with a damp cloth and let the dough rest for 1 hour. In the meantime, make the filling.

ingredients:
- 'For the dumpling dough:'
- 3½ cups all purpose flour
- 1 cup, plus 2 tablespoons tepid water
- '(You can also substitute storebought dumpling wrappers.) For the filling:'
- 3 tablespoons oil, plus ¼ cup (divided)
- 1 tablespoon minced ginger
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 2 cups shiitake mushrooms, chopped
- 1½ cups cabbage, finely shredded
- 1½ cups carrot, finely shredded
- 1 cup garlic chives (Chinese chives), finely chopped
- ½ teaspoon white pepper
- 2 teaspoons sesame oil
- 3 tablespoons Shaoxing wine or dry sherry
- 2 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon sugar salt, to taste
directions: 'heat, add 3 tablespoons oil and add the ginger. Cook for 30 seconds,
  until fragrant. Add the onions and stir-fry until translucent. Add the chopped mushrooms
  and stir-fry for another 3-5 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender and any liquid
  released by the mushrooms has cooked off. Add the cabbage and carrots and stir-fry
  for another 2 minutes, until the veggies are tender and all the liquid released
  has been cooked off. Transfer the vegetable mixture to a large mixing bowl and allow
  to cool. To the bowl, add the chopped chives, white pepper, sesame oil, shaoxing
  wine, soy sauce, and sugar. Season with salt to taste (though the soy sauce will
  usually add enough salt to the filling), and stir in the last ¼ cup of oil. To assemble
  the dumplings, cut the dough into small tablespoon-sized pieces. Roll each out into
  a circle, and pleat the dumplings. Continue assembling until you’ve run out of filling
  and/or dough. To cook the dumplings, steam them or pan-fry them. To steam, put the
  dumplings in a steamer lined with a bamboo mat, cabbage leaf, or cheese cloth, and
  steam for 15-20 minutes. To pan-fry, heat 2 tablespoons oil in a non-stick pan over
  medium high heat. Place the dumplings in the pan and allow to fry for 2 minutes.
  Pour a thin layer of water into the pan, cover, and reduce heat to medium-low. Allow
  dumplings to steam until the water has evaporated. Remove the cover, increase heat
  to medium-high and allow to fry for a few more minutes, until the bottoms of the
  dumplings are golden brown and crisp. Serve with our favorite dumpling sauce! To
  freeze: place dumplings on a parchment-lined baking sheet so they are not touching,
  and wrap tightly in clean plastic grocery bags. Freeze overnight, transfer the frozen
  dumplings to freezer bags, and return to the freezer for storage.'
