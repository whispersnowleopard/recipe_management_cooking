title: HOT & SOUR SOUP Bill’s
description: parents owned a takeout restaurant called Sun Hing, where his father
  would churn out his famed fried chicken wings, shrimp with lobster sauce, and fried
  rice. When it comes to our Chinese American takeout-style recipes, we try to create
  the best possible version of each dish. Hot & sour soup can be found on any takeout
  menu or Chinese buffet line in the U.S. It ranges in quality and flavor from awesomely
  delicious to lukewarm, tasteless, and gloopy. This version is really, in our view,
  the epitome of a good hot & sour soup. It’s a recipe we’re very proud of. See this
  recipe on the blog.

ingredients:
- ¼ cup cornstarch, plus 1 teaspoon ¼ cup water
- 1 to 2 dried red chili peppers
- 3 oz. pork shoulder or loin ½ teaspoon oil
- ¼ cup soaked dried lily flower
- ¼ cup soaked wood ears
- ¼ cup soaked dried shiitake mushrooms
- 1 small block of spiced tofu (1/4 cup)
- ¼ cup packaged firm tofu
- ¼ cup winter bamboo shoots
- (canned is ok, but fresh is better if available)
- 2 eggs
- 1 scallion
- 8 cups chicken stock
- ½ teaspoon fresh ground white pepper
- 2 teaspoon dark soy or mushroom soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon light or seasoned soy sauce Salt to taste
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 3 tablespoons white vinegar
- 1 pinch of sugar
directions: Mix ¼ cup cornstarch with an equal amount of water and use a spoon to
  stir until completely dissolved. Cut the dried chili peppers in half and discard
  the seeds. Mince them up and set aside. Slice the pork into small strips and place
  into a bowl with the last teaspoon of cornstarch and ½ teaspoon oil. Stir it all
  together. Soak the dried lily flower, wood ears, and mushrooms for an hour or two
  until re-hydrated. Once they’re ready, slice the mushrooms and give the wood ears
  a rough chop. Trim the tough ends off the lily flowers and cut them in half. Cut
  the spiced tofu and the firm tofu into 2-inch long and ¼-inch thick pieces. Slice
  the winter bamboo shoots into the same shape. Beat the two eggs in a bowl. Wash
  and chop the scallion and set aside. Bring the chicken stock to a boil in a wok
  or pot and add the pork. Stir to ensure the slices are not clumped together. Skim
  off any foam that floats to the top. Add the chili pepper, white pepper and both
  soy sauces, and check the soup for salt. Add the lily flowers, wood ears, mushrooms
  and bamboo shoots and bring the soup to a simmer. Add the two kinds of tofu, sesame
  oil, vinegar and a pinch of sugar and stir. It should start to look and smell like
  the real thing about now! Use a spoon to remix your cornstarch slurry in the bowl
  so it’s all combined. Bring the mixture to a simmer and use your soup ladle and
  stir the soup at the center of the wok in steady a circular motion to make a whirlpool
  while slowly pouring the cornstarch slurry in a thin stream. This prevents the cornstarch
  from clumping. Stop when you are about ¾ of the way done with your slurry to check
  the consistency of the soup. It should be thick enough to coat your spoon or ladle.
  Add the rest if needed. Keep the soup simmering and use the same technique with
  the beaten eggs and again, make sure the motion is fast enough or you will end up
  with egg clumps instead of the beautiful swirls or egg “flowers” (which is what
  the Chinese call it). Garnish with the chopped scallions and serve.
