title: HOMEMADE CHILI OIL Our
description: philosophy is that pretty much everything can be improved with some chili
  oil. A plate of noodles or a bowl of fried rice just isn’t as good without some
  on top. If you go to any Chinese restaurant (in the US or in China) worth their
  salt and ask for chili oil, they will bring out a deliciously fragrant, dark red,
  viscous chili oil that could make even a piece of shoe leather taste good. What’s
  surprising is, a truly excellent chili oil is actually pretty simple to make at
  home. Our family makes big batches of the stuff every few months. See this recipe
  on the blog.

ingredients:
- 2 1/4 CUPS
- 1½ cups vegetable or canola oil
- 5 star anise
- 1 cinnamon stick, preferably cassia cinnamon
- 2 bay leaves
- 3 tablespoons Sichuan peppercorns
- ¾ cup Asian crushed red pepper
- flakes (Sichuan chili flakes are the best)
- 1 - 1½ teaspoons salt (to taste)
directions: Heat the oil, star anise, cinnamon stick, bay leaves, and Sichuan peppercorns
  in a small saucepan over medium high heat. When the oil starts to bubble slightly,
  turn the heat down to medium low. The ideal heat should be about 225 to 250 degrees
  F so as not to burn the oil and spices. Caution that the oil and spices can burn
  really easily, so it’s best to get a candy thermometer to monitor the oil temperature.
  Let the oil cook for 30 minutes like this. If you start to see that slight bubbling
  die down, periodically turn the heat back up to medium-high, then back down to low
  if it gets too hot. When the oil is done cooking, the seeds and pods should be darker
  in color, but not blackened (that means they burned, which results in subpar chili
  oil). Let the oil cool for 5 minutes if it is too hot - the temperature should still
  be 225 to 250 degrees F. In a separate heat-proof bowl, measure out the crushed
  red pepper flakes and salt. Remove the aromatics from the oil using a slotted spoon
  or fine mesh strainer. Slowly pour the oil over the chili flakes, and stir well.
  When completely cooled, transfer to a jar, and store in the refrigerator. The oil
  will keep for up to 6 months when stored this way (always remember to use a clean
  spoon to dip into the jar!)
