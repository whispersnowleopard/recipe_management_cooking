title: CANTONESE SOY SAUCE PAN-FRIED NOODLES It’s
description: a Chinese noodle dish that we have to order every time we go out to dim
  sum. Perk up your ears while you’re getting your next dim sum fix. You might hear
  some people ordering something that sounds like “see yow wong chow meen.” Which
  is a bunch of fancy foreign words for “soy-saucy-pan-fried-noodles-that-are-the-most-awesome-thing-in-the-whole-wide-world.”
  And that’s a direct translation. Here’s our recipe for it. Just remember, you really
  need a HOT wok when making this dish to achieve that signature “wok hay” flavor.
  See this recipe on the blog.

ingredients:
- 1 1/2 cups bean sprouts
- 2 scallions
- 2 teaspoons soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon dark soy sauce
- ½ teaspoon sesame oil ¼ teaspoon salt ¼ teaspoon sugar
- ½ tablespoon shaoxing wine
- ¼ teaspoon freshly ground white pepper
- 8 oz. fresh thin Hong Kong Style
- Egg Noodles (for pan-frying,
- not to be mistaken for “wonton
- noodles”), or 3 small bundles of
- dried Hong Kong Style Egg Noodles for pan-frying
- 3 tablespoons oil
directions: Bring 2 quarts of water to a boil. Rinse the bean sprouts in cold water
  and drain. Julienne the scallions. Mix the soy sauces, sesame oil, salt, sugar,
  wine and white pepper into a small bowl and set aside. Boil the noodles. Fresh noodles
  should be boiled for about 1 minute. For dried noodles, boil for 2-3 minutes. Rinse
  in cold water and drain very well. Heat a wok over high heat and add a tablespoon
  of oil to coat the wok (a large non-stick pan also works nicely). Spread the noodles
  in a thin, even layer on the wok and tilt the wok in a circular motion to distribute
  the oil and crisp the bottom layer of the noodles evenly. It should take about 3-5
  minutes for the first side. Flip the noodles over and add another tablespoon of
  oil around the perimeter of the wok and let the other side crisp up. Don’t stress
  if you can’t turn the noodles over in one shot, The goal here is just to get an
  even, light crispiness and to dry out the noodles during this cooking stage. Set
  aside the noodles on a plate. Heat the wok over high heat. Add a tablespoon of oil
  and all of the white parts of the scallion to the pan and cook for about 15 seconds.
  Next, add the noodles to the wok and toss them well, breaking up the noodles so
  they’re not all in one big clump. Add the soy sauce mixture and toss continuously
  for a couple minutes using a pair of chopsticks or a set of tongs. Keep the heat
  on high. After the noodles are uniformly golden brown, add the bean sprouts and
  toss. Add the rest of the scallions and toss the mixture again for another 1 to
  2 minutes until you see the bean sprouts just starting to turn transparent. You
  want the sprouts to be cooked but still crunchy. Be careful not to overcook them
  or they will become limp and soggy. High heat is a key requirement for this dish.
  Plate and serve!
