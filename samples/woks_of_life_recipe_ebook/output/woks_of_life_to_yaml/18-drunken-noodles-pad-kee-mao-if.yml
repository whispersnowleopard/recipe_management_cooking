title: DRUNKEN NOODLES (PAD KEE MAO) If
description: you love Thai food, then you’re probably already familiar with drunken
  noodles, or pad kee mao. Rice noodles, flavorful chicken, holy basil (or Thai basil),
  and vegetables come together into a whole greater than the sum of its parts. You
  do need a very hot wok to make this dish and achieve that signature “wok hay” flavor.
  See this recipe on the blog. Work the 2 tablespoons of water into the sliced chicken
  with your hands until the chicken absorbs the liquid. Add 1 teaspoon soy sauce,
  1 teaspoon oil, and 2 teaspoons cornstarch, and mix until the chicken is evenly
  coated. Set aside for 20 minutes. Follow the directions on the rice noodle package
  to prepare your noodles. What we usually do is prepare a stainless steel bowl with
  hot tap water to soak the noodles for about 15 minutes. Then we just drain them
  and set aside for cooking.

ingredients:
- 'For the chicken & marinade:'
- 2 tablespoons water
- 12 ounces sliced chicken thighs or chicken breast
- 1 teaspoon soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon oil
- 2 teaspoons cornstarch
- 'For the rest of the dish:'
- 8 ounces wide dried rice noodles
- 1½ teaspoons brown sugar, dissolved in 1 tablespoon hot water
- 2 teaspoons soy sauce (Thai soy sauce preferred)
- 1 teaspoon dark soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon fish sauce
- 2 teaspoons oyster sauce
- pinch of ground white pepper
- 3 tablespoons vegetable or canola oil (divided)
- 3 cloves garlic, sliced
- ¼ teaspoon fresh grated ginger
- 2 shallots, sliced (about ⅓ cups)
- 1 scallion, julienned into 3-inch pieces
- 4 Thai red chili peppers, deseeded and julienned
- 1 cup loosely packed holy basil or Thai basil
- 5 to 6 pieces of baby corn, split in half (optional)
- 2 teaspoons Shaoxing wine
directions: Stir together the dissolved brown sugar mixture, soy sauces, fish sauce,
  oyster sauce, and white pepper in a small bowl and set aside. Heat your wok until
  it’s close to smoking, and spread 2 tablespoons of oil around the perimeter of the
  wok. Add the chicken and let it sear for 1 minute on each side until it’s about
  90% cooked. Remove from the wok and set aside. If the heat was high enough and you
  seared the meat correctly, your wok should be still clean with nothing sticking
  to it. If not, you can wash the wok to prevent the rice noodles from sticking. Continue
  with the wok on high heat and add 1 tablespoon of oil, along with the garlic and
  grated ginger. After a few seconds, add the shallots. Stir fry for 20 seconds and
  add the scallions, chili peppers, basil, baby corn and shaoxing wine. Stir-fry for
  another 20 seconds and add in the rice noodles. Use a scooping motion to mix everything
  for another minute until the noodles warm up. Next, add the prepared sauce mixture
  and stir-fry at the highest heat for about 1 minute until the noodles are uniform
  in color. Take care to use your metal spatula to scrape the bottom of the wok to
  prevent sticking. Add the seared chicken and stir-fry for another 1 to 2 minutes.
  Serve!
