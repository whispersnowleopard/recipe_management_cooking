title: SPICY BEEF NOODLE SOUP Spicy
description: beef noodle soup is exactly what we crave on cold nights (or any night
  really, who are we kidding). Make sure you don’t skip the step of pre-blanching
  the beef. This will give you a cleaner, clearer broth. As for the noodles, you can
  choose whatever noodles you like to use. Both fresh or dried noodles are fine––just
  remember to cook them in a separate pot, as they are very starchy. For a non-spicy
  version, try our Braised Beef Noodle Soup or our Instant Pot Taiwanese Beef Noodle
  Soup. See this recipe on the blog. You’ll need two large pots to make this recipe.
  Fill one large stock pot with 16 cups of cold water. Add the ginger, scallions,
  Shaoxing wine and beef chunks. Cover and bring to a boil. Immediately turn down
  the heat and simmer for 10 minutes. After that, turn off the heat and set aside.

ingredients:
- 16 cups cold water
- 6 slices ginger
- 3 scallions, washed and cut in half
- ¼ cup Shaoxing wine
- 3 lbs beef chuck, cut into 1½ inch chunks
- 3 tablespoon oil
- 1 to 2 tablespoons Sichuan peppercorns
- 2 heads of garlic, peeled
- 1 large onion, cut into chunks
- 5 star anise
- 4 bay leaves
- ¼ cup spicy bean paste
- 1 large tomato, cut into small chunks
- ½ cup light soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 large piece of dried tangerine peel
- fresh or dried wheat noodles of your choice
- Chopped scallion and cilantro, to garnish
directions: 'Heat the oil in another stock pot or large wok over medium low heat,
  and add the Sichuan peppercorns, garlic cloves, onion, star anise and bay leaves.
  Cook until the garlic cloves and onion chunks start to soften (about 5 - 10 minutes).
  Stir in the spicy bean paste. Then add the tomatoes and cook for two minutes. Finally,
  stir in the light soy sauce and sugar. Turn off the heat. Now, let’s scoop out the
  beef, ginger, and scallions from the 1st pot and transfer them to the 2nd pot. Then,
  pour in the stock through a fine mesh strainer. Place the pot over high heat, and
  add in the tangerine peel. Cover and bring the soup to a boil. Immediately turn
  the heat down to a simmer, and cook for 60-90 minutes. After simmering, turn off
  the heat, but keep the lid on, and let the pot sit on the stove (with the heat off)
  for another full hour to let the flavors meld together. Your soup base is done.
  Remember to bring the soup base to a boil again before serving. As an optional step,
  pick out the beef and strain the soup if you’d like to remove the spices and aromatics
  from the broth. Cook your noodles in a separate pot according to the package instructions,
  and divide among your serving bowls (you can get 8 generous servings out of your
  pot of soup and beef). Top the bowls with hot broth, beef, scallions, and cilantro.
  Serve piping hot! Note: If you still have leftover stock and beef, you can freeze
  it and reheat for future meals.'
