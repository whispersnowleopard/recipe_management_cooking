  have tried and loved this noodle soup, and you won’t be disappointed, either. It
  truly is a restaurant quality dish! See this recipe on the blog. In a large pot
  over medium heat, add the oil, garlic, ginger, and Thai red curry paste. Fry for
  5 minutes, until fragrant. Add the chicken and cook for a couple minutes, just until
  the chicken turns opaque. Add the chicken broth, water, fish sauce, and coconut
  milk. Bring to a boil. At this point, taste the broth for salt and adjust seasoning
  accordingly (add salt if needed, or if it’s too salty, add a bit of water). Pour
  the boiling soup over the dried vermicelli noodles in your serving bowls, add a
  squeeze of lime juice and your garnishes, and serve. The noodles will be ready to
  eat in a couple minutes. (Alternatively, you can add the noodles to the boiling
  broth to cook them, and then divide among serving bowls).
