title: CHINESE TURNIP CAKE (LO BAK GO) This
description: savory turnip cake (sometimes called radish cake), or lo bak go, is a
  traditional dish often served at dim sum houses or at home during Chinese New Year.
  Having sampled versions of turnip cake (or lo bak go, as it’s known in Cantonese)
  at many dim sum restaurants over the years, we’ve come to the conclusion that they
  can’t be compared to our homemade recipe. The restaurants definitely skimp on the
  filling ingredients, including the star of the dish, the Chinese turnip. Most of
  what you get is rice flour and starch. Our version is packed with mushrooms, Chinese
  sausage, and scallions for maximum flavor. See this recipe on the blog.

ingredients:
- 1 Chinese turnip/daikon radish
- (about 20 oz.), grated
- 1 to 1½ cups water Vegetable oil
- 1 tablespoon dried shrimp,
- washed, soaked and chopped
- 3-5 dried Chinese black mushrooms, washed, soaked, and chopped
- 1 Chinese sausage, diced
- 1 scallion, chopped
- 1¼ cups (130 grams) rice flour
- 1 tablespoon (8 grams) cornstarch ½ teaspoon salt ½ teaspoon sugar
- white pepper, to taste
- Oyster sauce for dipping
directions: 'Add the grated turnip and 1 cup water to a wok or large pan, and bring
  to a simmer. Simmer for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally so the turnip does
  not brown. The turnip will produce liquid, some of which will evaporate. You will
  have liquid left in the wok with the radish that you will also use. Scoop the cooked
  turnip into a large mixing bowl to cool. Pour any remaining liquid in the wok into
  a measuring cup, and add water until you have a total of 1 cup of liquid. Add it
  to the mixing bowl with the cooked turnip. Clean your wok or pan and place it over
  medium heat. Add a couple tablespoons oil. Add the shrimp, mushrooms, and sausage,
  and cook for about 5 minutes. Stir in the chopped scallion and remove from the heat
  to cool. Add rice flour, cornstarch, salt, sugar, and white pepper to the mixing
  bowl with the radish and cooking liquid. Mix well until the dry ingredients are
  well-incorporated. Add in the cooked shrimp, mushrooms and sausage, and be sure
  to scrape the oil from the pan into the batter. Mix well and let sit for 15 minutes.
  Give the batter a final stir, and pour it into a well-oiled loaf pan. Place the
  pan into a steamer with plenty of water and steam over medium-high heat for 50 minutes.
  Remove the pan from the steamer and let your turnip cake set for about 30 minutes.
  Once cooled, loosen the sides with a spatula and turn it out onto a cutting board.
  It should come out quite easily. Use a sharp knife dipped in water to slice ½-inch
  thick pieces. I know people who’d enjoy it just like that, but most people pan-fry
  the turnip cake first. Add a couple tablespoons oil to a non-stick or seasoned cast
  iron pan over medium heat. Fry the cakes on both sides until golden and crispy.
  Serve with oyster sauce! Note: You can also make this turnip cake in advance, refrigerate
  it in the loaf pan, and slice/fry later. If you’ve refrigerated turnip cakes that
  you’ve already fried, the best way to reheat them is to re-fry them in a pan.'
