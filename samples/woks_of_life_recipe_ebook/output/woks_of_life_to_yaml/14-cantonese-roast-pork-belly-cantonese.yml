title: CANTONESE ROAST PORK BELLY Cantonese
description: Roast Pork Belly, or siu yuk in Cantonese, can often be found in Chinatown
  restaurant windows, but is rarely seen in home kitchens. The perception is that
  this is a difficult thing to make at home, but you’d be surprised at how simple
  it is. The effort to make this yourself is totally worth it of course. When you
  see the skin crispy skin puffing up in your oven, you’ll see what we mean! The secret
  to the signature crackling is poking lots of holes into the pork belly skin, just
  before you hit the fat layer underneath. This creates air pockets that allow the
  skin to puff up. It’s like magic! See this recipe on the blog. Rinse the pork belly
  and pat dry. Place it skin-side down on a tray, and rub the shaoxing wine into the
  meat (not the skin). Mix together the salt, sugar, five spice powder and white pepper.
  Thoroughly rub this spice mixture into the meat as well. Flip the meat over so it’s
  skin-side up. So, to do the next step, there’s actually a special tool that restaurants
  use, but we just used a sharp metal skewer. Systematically poke holes all over the
  skin, which will help the skin crisp up, rather than stay smooth and leathery. The
  more holes there are, the better. Also make sure they go deep enough. Stop just
  above the fat layer underneath.

ingredients:
- 3 lb slab of pork belly, skin on
- 2 teaspoons Shaoxing wine
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- ½ teaspoon five spice powder
- ¼ teaspoon white pepper
- 1½ teaspoons rice wine vinegar
- ½ cup coarse sea salt
directions: Let the pork belly dry out in the fridge uncovered, for 12-24 hours. Preheat
  the oven to 375 degrees F. Place a large piece of aluminum foil (heavy duty foil
  works best) onto a baking tray, and fold up the sides around the pork snugly, so
  that you’re creating a kind of box all around it, with a 1-inch high border going
  around the sides. Brush the rice wine vinegar on top of the pork skin. Pack the
  sea salt in one even layer over the skin, so the pork is completely covered. Place
  in the oven and roast for 1 hour and 30 minutes. If your pork belly still has the
  rib attached, roast for 1 hour and 45 minutes. Take the pork out of the oven, turn
  on the broiler to low, and position the oven rack in the lowest position. Remove
  the top layer of sea salt from the pork belly, unfold the foil, and place a roasting
  rack on the pan. Place the pork belly on the rack and put it back under the broiler
  to crisp up. This should take 10-15 minutes. The broiler should ideally be on “low”
  so that this process can happen gradually. If your broiler gets pretty hot, keep
  a close eye on it and be sure to keep the pork as far away from the heat source
  as possible. When the skin has puffed up and gotten crispy, remove from the oven.
  Let it rest for about 15 minutes. Slice and serve!
