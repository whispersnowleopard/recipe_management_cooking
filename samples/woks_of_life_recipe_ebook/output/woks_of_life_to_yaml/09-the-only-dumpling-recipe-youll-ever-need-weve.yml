title: THE ONLY DUMPLING RECIPE YOU’LL EVER NEED We’ve
description: been making this dumpling recipe for a long time, working together to
  fold hundreds of them before freezing them in huge batches for future breakfasts,
  party appetizers, and late-night snacks. This was the first dumpling recipe we ever
  posted on the blog, and the reason we called it “the only dumpling recipe you’ll
  ever need” is because it’s really more of a template than a recipe. You have the
  freedom to change what vegetables you’d like to add, the type of meat you’d like
  to use, as well as the ratio of vegetable to meat. Use our recipe as a guide and
  experiment on your own. See this recipe on the blog. Wash your vegetables thoroughly
  and blanch them in a pot of boiling water.

ingredients:
- 3 lbs green leafy vegetable (like
- shepherd’s purse, baby bok choy,
- napa cabbage, or Chinese chives)
- 1 ½ pounds ground pork (or
- ground chicken or beef, as long
- as they aren’t too lean)
- ⅔ cup shaoxing wine ½ cup oil
- 3 tablespoons sesame oil
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 3 tablespoons soy sauce
- ¼ teaspoon white pepper
- ⅔ cup water, plus more for assembly
- 3-4 packages circular dumpling wrappers
directions: 'Transfer them to an ice bath to cool. Ring out all the water from the
  vegetables and chop very finely. In a large bowl, stir together the vegetable, meat,
  wine, oil, sesame oil, salt, soy sauce, white pepper, and ⅔ cup water. Mix for 6-8
  minutes, until very well-combined and almost paste-like in texture. To wrap the
  dumplings, dampen the edges of each circular dumpling wrapper with some water. Put
  a little less than a tablespoon of filling in the middle. Fold the circle in half
  and pinch the wrapper together at the top. Then make two folds on each side, until
  the dumpling looks like a fan. Make sure it’s completely sealed. Repeat until all
  the filling is gone, placing the dumplings on a baking sheet lined with parchment
  so they aren’t touching. If you’d like to freeze them, wrap the baking sheets tightly
  in clean plastic grocery bags and put the pans in the freezer. Allow them to freeze
  overnight. You can then take the sheets out of the freezer, transfer the dumplings
  to freezer bags, and throw them back in the freezer for use later. To cook the dumplings,
  boil them or pan-fry them. To boil, simple bring a large pot of water to a boil,
  drop the dumplings in, and cook until they float to the top and the skins are cooked
  through, but still slightly al dente. To pan-fry, heat 2 tablespoons oil in a non-stick
  pan over medium high heat. Place the dumplings in the pan and allow to fry for 2
  minutes. Pour a thin layer of water into the pan, cover, and reduce heat to medium-low.
  Allow dumplings to steam until the water has evaporated. Remove the cover, increase
  heat to medium-high and fry for a few more minutes, until the bottoms of the dumplings
  are golden brown and crisp. Serve with Chinese black vinegar, chili sauce, or our
  favorite dumpling sauce! Note: Find the dumpling wrappers fresh at the Asian grocery
  store. Look for the white, round ones. If they start to dry out, wrap them in a
  damp kitchen towel and put them in a sealed plastic bag for a couple hours to soften
  back up. Freeze any unused dumpling wrappers in an airtight sealed plastic bag for
  later.'
