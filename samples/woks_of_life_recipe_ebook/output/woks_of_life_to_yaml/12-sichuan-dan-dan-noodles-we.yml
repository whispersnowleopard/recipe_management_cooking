description: 'won’t sugarcoat it. Dan Dan noodles aren’t all that simple to make.
  The dish requires many different ingredients to accomplish a layered, complex flavor.
  But you can think of this dish having four parts: the chili oil, the meat'

ingredients:
- 'For the chili oil:'
- 2 tablespoons Sichuan peppercorns
- 1 inch-long piece of cinnamon
- 2 star anise
- 1 cup oil
- ¼ cup crushed red pepper flakes
- 'For the meat & sui mi ya cai:'
- 3 teaspoons oil (divided)
- 8 oz. ground pork
- 2 teaspoons sweet bean sauce or hoisin sauce
- 2 teaspoons shaoxing wine
- 1 teaspoon dark soy sauce
- ½ teaspoon five spice powder
- '⅓ cup sui mi ya cai For the sauce:'
- 2 tablespoons sesame paste (tahini)
- 3 tablespoons soy sauce
- 2 teaspoons sugar
- ¼ teaspoon five spice powder
- ½ teaspoon Sichuan peppercorn
- powder (we ground whole Sichuan peppercorns in a mortar and pestle)
- ½ cup of your prepared chili oil (scary, but yes!)
- 2 cloves garlic, very finely minced
- ¼ cup hot cooking water from the noodles
- 'For the noodles & veggies:'
- 1 lb fresh or dried white noodles, medium thickness
- '1 small bunch leafy greens (spinach, bok choy, or choy sum) To assemble: chopped
  peanuts (optional) chopped scallion'
directions: 'mixture and sui mi ya cai (pickled vegetables you can find at your local
  Chinese grocery store), the sauce, and the noodles/leafy greens. Divide and conquer.
  With this tested and approved recipe, you’ve won half of the battle already. No
  guts, no glory. See this recipe on the blog. To make the chili oil: In a small pot,
  add the Sichuan peppercorns, cinnamon stick, star anise, and oil. Over medium low
  heat, slowly heat to 325 degrees, and then turn off the heat. Wait 6 - 7 minutes,
  then remove the peppercorns, cinnamon stick, and star anise with a slotted spoon.
  Add the crushed red pepper flakes and allow them to steep in the hot oil. It should
  start smelling fragrant, almost like popcorn. Allow the oil to cool. This makes
  more chili oil than you’ll need, but you’ll be glad to have it on hand for use in
  other dishes. Store in a glass jar and keep refrigerated. To make the meat mixture:
  In a wok, heat a teaspoon of oil over medium heat, and brown the ground pork. Add
  the sweet bean sauce, shaoxing wine, dark soy sauce, and five spice powder. Cook
  until all the liquid is evaporated. Set aside. Heat the other 2 teaspoons of oil
  in the wok over medium heat, and sautee the sui mi ya cai (pickled vegetables) for
  a few minutes. Set aside. To make the sauce: Mix together all the sauce ingredients.
  Taste and adjust seasoning if you like. You can loosen it with more hot water, add
  more Sichuan peppercorn powder, etc. To prepare the noodles and veggies: Cook the
  noodles according to package directions and drain. Blanch the greens in the noodle
  water, and drain. Divide the sauce among four bowls, followed by the noodles and
  the leafy greens. Add the cooked pork and sui mi ya cai over the top. Sprinkle with
  chopped peanuts (optional) and scallions. Mix everything together and enjoy!'
