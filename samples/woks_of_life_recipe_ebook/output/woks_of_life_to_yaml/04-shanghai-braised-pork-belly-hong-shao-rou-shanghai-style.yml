title: SHANGHAI BRAISED PORK BELLY (HONG SHAO ROU) Shanghai-Style
description: Braised Pork Belly (hong shao rou), or “red cooked pork,” is a very famous
  dish in China. Everyone knows it, and there are many versions and twists based on
  the original. Some of the more well-known variations include the addition of squid
  (sounds odd, but boy, is it tasty), hard boiled eggs, and tofu knots (one of Sarah’s
  favorites). But since Judy is from Shanghai, we often like to

ingredients:
- 3 /4 lb. of lean pork belly, skin-on
- 2 tablespoons oil
- 1 tablespoon sugar (rock sugar is
- preferred if you have it)
- 3 tablespoons shaoxing wine
- 1 tablespoon regular soy sauce
- ½ tablespoon dark soy sauce
- 2 cups water
directions: 'cook this original, un-embellished Shanghai-style version. See this recipe
  on the blog. Start by cutting your pork belly into 3/4-inch thick pieces. Bring
  a pot of water to a boil. Blanch the pork belly pieces for a couple minutes. This
  gets rid of impurities and starts the cooking process. Take the pork out of the
  pot, rinse, and set aside. Over low heat, add the oil and sugar to your wok. Melt
  the sugar slightly and add the pork. Raise the heat to medium and cook until the
  pork is lightly browned. Turn the heat back down to low and add shaoxing cooking
  wine, regular soy sauce, dark soy sauce, and water. NOTE: It’s very important to
  the color and flavor of this dish that you have both kinds of soy sauce! Just head
  to your local Asian market, buy a bottle of each, and it will last you a year! Cover
  and simmer for about 45 minutes to 1 hour until pork is fork tender. Every 5-10
  minutes, stir to prevent burning and add more water if it gets too dry. Once the
  pork is fork tender, if there is still a lot of visible liquid, uncover the wok,
  turn up the heat, and stir continuously until the sauce has reduced to a glistening
  coating.'
