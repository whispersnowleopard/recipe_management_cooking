title: CLASSIC PORK FRIED RICE Pork
description: fried rice is probably one of the most popular take-out dishes out there,
  as well as a classic Chinese dish (anything involving rice and pork is likely to
  be a winner with a Chinese audience). In Bill’s parents’ restaurant, we used to

ingredients:
- 1 tablespoon hot water

- 1 teaspoon dark soy sauce
- ¼ teaspoon white pepper
- 5 cups cooked white rice

directions: serve pork fried rice as a side dish accompanying tons of other main dishes,
  so we were churning out orders of it on a regular basis. It may not be the most
  glamorous dish, but when done right, it is truly great. You can make your own roast
  pork using our char siu roast pork recipe in this eBook, or if you have a good Chinese
  market or restaurant near you that sells BBQ pork, you can buy it. See this recipe
  on the blog. Start by combining the hot water, honey, sesame oil, shaoxing wine,
  soy sauce, dark soy sauce, and white pepper in a small bowl. This is the sauce that
  you’ll be adding to the rice, and it’s much easier to have it combined and ready
  to go before you start cooking. Take your cooked rice and fluff it with a fork or
  with your hands (you can rinse your hands in cold water if the rice starts sticking
  to them). There shouldn’t be any big clumps! With the wok over medium heat, add
  a tablespoon of oil and sauté the onions until translucent. Stir in the roast pork.
  Add the rice and mix well. If the rice is cold from the refrigerator, continue stir-frying
  until the rice is warmed up, which will take about 5 minutes. If the rice was made
  fresh, then you just need to mix until everything is incorporated. Add the sauce
  mixture and salt, and mix with a scooping motion until the rice is evenly coated
  with sauce. Break up any remaining clumps of rice with the spatula as best as possible.
  The rice should be hot by this time. Toss in your eggs, mung bean sprouts, and scallions.
  Mix thoroughly for another minute or two and serve!
