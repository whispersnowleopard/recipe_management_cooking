title: STEAMED BBQ PORK BUNS These
description: steamed BBQ pork buns, or Char Siu Bao, are enjoyed by kids and adults
  alike. We tested and perfected the perfect steamed bun recipe for these. They are
  snowy white and cracked open on top. Unlike other steamed buns, which usually start
  with cold water and are steamed over medium heat, these buns require you to pre-boil
  the water in the steamer, forcing the buns to rise quickly so the tops crack. You
  can either buy ready-made char siu (BBQ roast pork) at a local Chinese grocery or
  Cantonese restaurant, or you can make your own using our recipe on page 42 of this
  eBook. See this recipe on the blog. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with
  a dough hook attachment (you can also use a regular mixing bowl and knead by hand),
  dissolve 1 teaspoon active dry yeast in 3/4 cup warm water. Sift together the flour
  and cornstarch, and add it to the yeast mixture along with the sugar and oil. Turn
  on the mixer to the lowest setting and let it go until a smooth dough ball is formed.
  Cover with a damp cloth and let it rest for 2 hours. (You’ll add the baking powder
  later!) While the dough is resting, make the meat filling. Heat 1 tablespoon of
  oil

ingredients:
- 'For the steamed bun dough:'
- 1 teaspoon active dry yeast
- ¾ cup warm water
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 cup cornstarch
- 5 tablespoons sugar
- ¼ cup canola or vegetable oil
- '2½ teaspoons baking powder For the filling:'
- 1 tablespoon oil
- ⅓ cup finely chopped shallots or red onion
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 tablespoon light soy sauce
- 1½ tablespoons oyster sauce
- 2 teaspoons sesame oil
- 2 teaspoons dark soy sauce
- ½ cup chicken stock
- 2 tablespoons all purpose flour
- 1½ cups diced Chinese roast
- pork (you can buy it ready-made,
- or see our recipe to make your own)
directions: 'in a wok over medium high heat. Add the shallots/onions and stir-fry
  for 1 minute. Turn heat down to medium-low, and add the sugar, light soy sauce,
  oyster sauce, sesame oil, and dark soy sauce. Stir and cook until the mixture starts
  to bubble up. Add the chicken stock and flour, cooking for 3 minutes until thickened.
  Remove from the heat and stir in the roast pork. Set aside to cool. If you make
  the filling ahead of time, cover and refrigerate to prevent it from drying out.
  After your dough has rested for 2 hours, add the baking powder to the dough and
  turn the mixer on to the lowest setting. At this point, if the dough looks dry or
  you’re having trouble incorporating the baking powder, add 1-2 teaspoons water.
  Gently knead the dough until it becomes smooth again. Cover with a damp cloth and
  let it rest for another 15 minutes. In the meantime, get a large piece of parchment
  paper and cut it into ten 4x4 inch squares. Prepare your steamer by bringing the
  water to a boil. Now we are ready to assemble the buns: roll the dough into a long
  tube and divide it into 10 equal pieces. Press each piece of dough into a disc about
  4½ inches in diameter (it should be thicker in the center and thinner around the
  edges). Add some filling and pleat the buns until they’re closed on top. Place each
  bun on a parchment paper square, and steam. I steamed the buns in two separate batches
  using a bamboo steamer (be sure the boiling water does not touch the buns during
  steaming process). Once the water boils, place the buns in the steamer and steam
  each batch for 12 minutes over high heat.'
