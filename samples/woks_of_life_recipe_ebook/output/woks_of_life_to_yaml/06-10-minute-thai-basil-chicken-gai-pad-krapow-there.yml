ingredients:
- 3 to 4 tablespoons oil

- 3 shallots, thinly sliced
- 5 cloves garlic, sliced
- 1 pound ground chicken

- 1 tablespoon fish sauce
- ⅓ cup low sodium chicken broth or water
- 1 bunch holy basil or Thai basil leaves
directions: In a wok over high heat, add the oil, chilies, shallots and garlic, and
  fry for 1-2 minutes. Add the ground chicken and stir-fry for 2 minutes, breaking
  up the chicken into small bits. Add the sugar, soy sauce, and fish sauce. Stir-fry
  for another minute and deglaze the pan with the broth. Because your pan is over
  high heat, the liquid should cook off very quickly. Add the basil, and stir-fry
