title: GENERAL TSO’S CAULIFLOWER Just
description: when you thought the world had run out of ways to cook cauliflower (cauliflower
  pizza dough, cauliflower rice, cauliflower dips, cauliflower soup, etc. etc.), General
  Tso’s Cauliflower has arrived to once again change your perception of this humble
  vegetable. A vegetarian version of everyone’s favorite takeout dish, General Tso’s
  Chicken, the cauliflower is crispy on the outside and moist on the inside, tossed
  in a tasty sauce. We were introduced to this idea by an old family friend who became
  vegan years ago. Of course, the second we’d tried it, we decided to blog the recipe,
  and the rest is history. See this recipe on the blog. Cut the cauliflower into 1to
  2-inch chunks. Mix the cornstarch, baking soda, salt, sesame oil, white pepper,
  water, and ¾ cup of rice flour in a large bowl until it forms a batter. Toss in
  the cauliflower and fold together until the cauliflower is well coated. Sprinkle
  the remaining ¼ cup of rice flour over the cauliflower, and stir until everything
  is sticking to the cauliflower. There should be no more batter at the bottom of
  the bowl. If there is, just add a little bit more rice flour. Next, sprinkle the
  toasted sesame seeds evenly over the cauliflower. Heat the oil to 375 degrees in
  a cast iron pan or small pot. Fry the cauliflower in batches until light golden
  brown and crunchy (about 3 minutes), and transfer to a baking sheet lined with paper
  towels. Make the sauce. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in your wok over medium heat. Add
  the minced ginger, and fry for 15 seconds. Add the garlic and dried red chilies
  (if using). Stir for 10 seconds. Add the Shaoxing wine, sesame oil, soy sauce, rice
  wine vinegar, sugar, and water (or chicken stock). Turn the heat down to low, letting
  the entire mixture come to a simmer. If you fried the cauliflower in advance and
  want the pieces to be extra crispy, re-fry the cauliflower in batches for about
  20 seconds or until golden brown, and drain on paper towels. Add the cornstarch
  slurry gradually to the sauce while stirring constantly, and simmer for 20 seconds.
  The sauce should be thick enough to coat a spoon.
