HOMEMADE CHILI OIL Our,,"philosophy is that pretty much everything can be improved with some chili oil. A plate of noodles or a bowl of fried rice just isn’t as good without some on top. If you go to any Chinese restaurant (in the US or in China) worth their salt and ask for chili oil, they will bring out a deliciously fragrant, dark red, viscous chili oil that could make even a piece of shoe leather taste good. What’s surprising is, a truly excellent chili oil is actually pretty simple to make at home. Our family makes big batches of the stuff every few months. See this recipe on the blog.",https://thewoksoflife.com,,,,,,"2 1/4 CUPS
1½ cups vegetable or canola oil
5 star anise
1 cinnamon stick, preferably cassia cinnamon
2 bay leaves
3 tablespoons Sichuan peppercorns
¾ cup Asian crushed red pepper
flakes (Sichuan chili flakes are the best)
1 - 1½ teaspoons salt (to taste)","Heat the oil, star anise, cinnamon stick, bay leaves, and Sichuan peppercorns in a small saucepan over medium high heat. When the oil starts to bubble slightly, turn the heat down to medium low. The ideal heat should be about 225 to 250 degrees F so as not to burn the oil and spices. Caution that the oil and spices can burn really easily, so it’s best to get a candy thermometer to monitor the oil temperature. Let the oil cook for 30 minutes like this. If you start to see that slight bubbling die down, periodically turn the heat back up to medium-high, then back down to low if it gets too hot. When the oil is done cooking, the seeds and pods should be darker in color, but not blackened (that means they burned, which results in subpar chili oil). Let the oil cool for 5 minutes if it is too hot - the temperature should still be 225 to 250 degrees F. In a separate heat-proof bowl, measure out the crushed red pepper flakes and salt. Remove the aromatics from the oil using a slotted spoon or fine mesh strainer. Slowly pour the oil over the chili flakes, and stir well. When completely cooled, transfer to a jar, and store in the refrigerator. The oil will keep for up to 6 months when stored this way (always remember to use a clean spoon to dip into the jar!)",chinese;quick,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mix the soy sauces, sesame oil, salt, sugar, wine and white pepper into a small bowl and set aside. Boil the noodles. Fresh noodles should be boiled for about 1 minute. For dried noodles, boil for 2-3 minutes. Rinse in cold water and drain very well. Heat a wok over high heat and add a tablespoon of oil to coat the wok (a large non-stick pan also works nicely). Spread the noodles in a thin, even layer on the wok and tilt the wok in a circular motion to distribute the oil and crisp the bottom layer of the noodles evenly. It should take about 3-5 minutes for the first side. Flip the noodles over and add another tablespoon of oil around the perimeter of the wok and let the other side crisp up. Don’t stress if you can’t turn the noodles over in one shot, The goal here is just to get an even, light crispiness and to dry out the noodles during this cooking stage. Set aside the noodles on a plate. Heat the wok over high heat. Add a tablespoon of oil and all of the white parts of the scallion to the pan and cook for about 15 seconds. Next, add the noodles to the wok and toss them well, breaking up the noodles so they’re not all in one big clump. Add the soy sauce mixture and toss continuously for a couple minutes using a pair of chopsticks or a set of tongs. Keep the heat on high. After the noodles are uniformly golden brown, add the bean sprouts and toss. Add the rest of the scallions and toss the mixture again for another 1 to 2 minutes until you see the bean sprouts just starting to turn transparent. You want the sprouts to be cooked but still crunchy. Be careful not to overcook them or they will become limp and soggy. High heat is a key requirement for this dish.

GENERAL TSO’S CAULIFLOWER Just,,"when you thought the world had run out of ways to cook cauliflower (cauliflower pizza dough, cauliflower rice, cauliflower dips, cauliflower soup, etc. etc.), General Tso’s Cauliflower has arrived to once again change your perception of this humble vegetable.

Toss in the cauliflower and fold together until the cauliflower is well coated. Sprinkle the remaining ¼ cup of rice flour over the cauliflower, and stir until everything is sticking to the cauliflower. There should be no more batter at the bottom of the bowl. If there is, just add a little bit more rice flour. Next, sprinkle the toasted sesame seeds evenly over the cauliflower. Heat the oil to 375 degrees in a cast iron pan or small pot.

In a large bowl, stir together the vegetable, meat, wine, oil, sesame oil, salt, soy sauce, white pepper, and ⅔ cup water. Mix for 6-8 minutes, until very well-combined and almost paste-like in texture. To wrap the dumplings, dampen the edges of each circular dumpling wrapper with some water. Put a little less than a tablespoon of filling in the middle. Fold the circle in half and pinch the wrapper together at the top. Then make two folds on each side, until the dumpling looks like a fan. Make sure it’s completely sealed. Repeat until all the filling is gone, placing the dumplings on a baking sheet lined with parchment so they aren’t touching. If you’d like to freeze them, wrap the baking sheets tightly in clean plastic grocery bags and put the pans in the freezer. Allow them to freeze overnight. You can then take the sheets out of the freezer, transfer the dumplings to freezer bags, and throw them back in the freezer for use later. To cook the dumplings, boil them or pan-fry them. To boil, simple bring a large pot of water to a boil, drop the dumplings in, and cook until they float to the top and the skins are cooked through, but still slightly al dente. To pan-fry, heat 2 tablespoons oil in a non-stick pan over medium high heat. Place the dumplings in the pan and allow to fry for 2 minutes. Pour a thin layer of water into the pan, cover, and reduce heat to medium-low. Allow dumplings to steam until the water has evaporated. Remove the cover, increase heat to medium-high and fry for a few more minutes, until the bottoms of the dumplings are golden brown and crisp.

If you make the filling ahead of time, cover and refrigerate to prevent it from drying out. After your dough has rested for 2 hours, add the baking powder to the dough and turn the mixer on to the lowest setting. At this point, if the dough looks dry or you’re having trouble incorporating the baking powder, add 1-2 teaspoons water. Gently knead the dough until it becomes smooth again. Cover with a damp cloth and let it rest for another 15 minutes. In the meantime, get a large piece of parchment paper and cut it into ten 4x4 inch squares. Prepare your steamer by bringing the water to a boil. Now we are ready to assemble the buns: roll the dough into a long tube and divide it into 10 equal pieces. Press each piece of dough into a disc about 4½ inches in diameter (it should be thicker in the center and thinner around the edges). Add some filling and pleat the buns until they’re closed on top. Place each bun on a parchment paper square, and steam. I steamed the buns in two separate batches using a bamboo steamer (be sure the boiling water does not touch the buns during steaming process). Once the water boils, place the buns in the steamer and steam each batch for 12 minutes over high heat.",chinese;quick,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CANTONESE ROAST PORK BELLY Cantonese,,"Roast Pork Belly, or siu yuk in Cantonese, can often be found in Chinatown restaurant windows, but is rarely seen in home kitchens. The perception is that this is a difficult thing to make at home, but you’d be surprised at how simple it is. The effort to make this yourself is totally worth it of course. When you see the skin crispy skin puffing up in your oven, you’ll see what we mean! The secret to the signature crackling is poking lots of holes into the pork belly skin, just before you hit the fat layer underneath. This creates air pockets that allow the skin to puff up. It’s like magic! See this recipe on the blog. Rinse the pork belly and pat dry. Place it skin-side down on a tray, and rub the shaoxing wine into the meat (not the skin). Mix together the salt, sugar, five spice powder and white pepper. Thoroughly rub this spice mixture into the meat as well. Flip the meat over so it’s skin-side up. So, to do the next step, there’s actually a special tool that restaurants use, but we just used a sharp metal skewer. Systematically poke holes all over the skin, which will help the skin crisp up, rather than stay smooth and leathery. The more holes there are, the better. Also make sure they go deep enough. Stop just above the fat layer underneath.",https://thewoksoflife.com,,,,6,,"3 lb slab of pork belly, skin on
2 teaspoons Shaoxing wine
2 teaspoons salt

½ teaspoon five spice powder
¼ teaspoon white pepper

½ cup coarse sea salt","Let the pork belly dry out in the fridge uncovered, for 12-24 hours. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Place a large piece of aluminum foil (heavy duty foil works best) onto a baking tray, and fold up the sides around the pork snugly, so that you’re creating a kind of box all around it, with a 1-inch high border going around the sides. Brush the rice wine vinegar on top of the pork skin. Pack the sea salt in one even layer over the skin, so the pork is completely covered. Place in the oven and roast for 1 hour and 30 minutes. If your pork belly still has the rib attached, roast for 1 hour and 45 minutes. Take the pork out of the oven, turn on the broiler to low, and position the oven rack in the lowest position. Remove the top layer of sea salt from the pork belly, unfold the foil, and place a roasting rack on the pan. Place the pork belly on the rack and put it back under the broiler to crisp up. This should take 10-15 minutes. The broiler should ideally be on “low” so that this process can happen gradually. If your broiler gets pretty hot, keep a close eye on it and be sure to keep the pork as far away from the heat source as possible. When the skin has puffed up and gotten crispy, remove from the oven. Let it rest for about 15 minutes. Slice and serve!",quick,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ASIAN MILK BREAD There,,"are many milk bread recipes on the Internet, and many of them are quite complicated. No matter how closely we followed many of these recipes, on other food blogs and Chinese recipe sites alike, we were never satisfied with the outcome. All along, it turned out our cousin Heidi had the perfect recipe. It was the closest in taste and texture to Chinese bakery milk bread and also incredibly easy to make. You just have to put everything in the mixer to make the dough, proof for 60 minutes, knead the dough again, shape it, proof, and bake. The final product is fluffy, soft, slightly sweet, and golden. See this recipe on the blog. In the bowl of a mixer, add ingredients in the following order: heavy cream, milk, egg, sugar, cake flour, bread flour, yeast, and salt. Use the dough hook attachment, and turn on the mixer to “stir.” Let it go for 15 minutes, occasionally stopping the mixer to push the dough together. If you’re in a humid climate and the dough is too sticky, feel free to add a little more flour ¼ cup at a time until it comes together. If you don’t have a mixer and would like to knead by hand, extend the kneading time by 5-10 minutes. After 15 minutes of kneading, the dough is ready for proofing. Cover the bowl with a damp towel and place in a warm spot for 1 hour. We proof the dough in our oven (We turned on our oven’s rapid proof setting for 5 minutes, turned the oven off, and then closed the oven door). The dough will grow to 1.5X its original size. In the meantime, grease two baking vessels on all sides with butter, such as 2 standard loaf pans or even a loaf pan and a 9-inch round cake pan. After the hour of proofing, put the dough back in the mixer and stir for another 5 minutes to get rid of air bubbles. Dump the dough on a lightly floured surface, and cut it in half. You can make a loaf with one half of the dough by cutting it into 3 pieces and placing them in the loaf pan. With the other half of the dough, cut it into eight equal pieces and make buns. You can really shape the dough however you like––2 loaves, 1 loaf and a 1 pan of buns, or even 12-16 individual buns. Once shaped, let the dough proof for another hour.",https://thewoksoflife.com,,,,2,,"OR 12-16 BUNS

"SIMPLE WONTON SOUP Traditionally,",,"wontons are very delicate little things, sometimes filled with vegetables and usually pork…served in a flavorful chicken soup seasoned with some sesame oil and white pepper. There are different types and versions, but for us, this is wonton soup in its simplest, purest form. Head to your local Asian grocer for the wonton wrappers. You’ll see a couple different kinds, including ones made with white flour, and others made with eggs. For this recipe, you’re looking for square shaped wrappers that are white. This recipe makes about three dozen, or about four to six servings. See this recipe on the blog. Start by thoroughly washing the vegetables. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and blanch the vegetables just until wilted. Drain and rinse in cold water. Grab a good clump of veg and carefully squeeze out as much water as you can. Very finely chop the vegetables (you can also speed up the process by throwing them in the food processor).",https://thewoksoflife.com,,,,3,,"10 oz. baby bok choy or similar green vegetable

1 tablespoon sesame oil
White pepper and salt to taste
1 scallion, chopped","In a medium bowl, add the finely chopped vegetables, ground pork, sesame oil, white pepper, soy sauce, salt, and shaoxing wine. Mix very thoroughly until the mixture is totally emulsified—almost like a paste. Now it’s time to assemble! Fill a small bowl with water. Grab a wrapper and use your finger to moisten the edges of the wrapper. Add a little over a teaspoon of filling to the middle. Fold the wrapper in half and press the two sides together so you get a firm seal. Hold the bottom two corners of the little rectangle you just made and bring the two corners together. You can use a bit of water to make sure they stick. And that’s it! Keep assembling until all the filling is gone. Place the wontons on a baking sheet or plate lined with parchment paper to prevent sticking. At this point, you can cover the wontons with plastic wrap, put the baking sheet/plate into the freezer, and transfer them to Ziploc bags once they’re frozen. They’ll keep for a couple months in the freezer, and be ready for wonton soup whenever you want it. To make the soup, heat your chicken stock to a simmer and add sesame oil, white pepper, and salt. Bring a separate pot of water to a boil. Carefully add the wontons one at a time to the pot. Stir to prevent the wontons from sticking to the bottom. If they do stick, don’t worry, They should come free once they’re cooked. They’re done when they float. Take care not to overcook them. Remove the wontons with a slotted spoon and put them in bowls.

Cover and store the reserved marinade in the fridge as well. Preheat your oven to the highest setting (475-550 degrees F or 250-290 degrees C) with a rack positioned in the upper third of the oven. Line a sheet pan with foil and place a metal rack on top. Place the pork on the rack, leaving as much space as possible between pieces. Pour 1 ½ cups water into the pan below the rack. This prevents any drippings from burning or smoking. Transfer the pork to your preheated oven and roast for 25 minutes. After 25 minutes, flip the pork.

EGG DROP SOUP The,,"name “Egg Drop” comes from how the soup is made—dropping raw egg into hot soup to cook it. It doesn’t take a genius to figure that out. But actually, the direct translation in Chinese is “egg flower soup,” because the egg creates large and small swirls in the soup in a flower-like pattern.

1 scallion, chopped","Bring the chicken stock to a simmer in a medium soup pot. Stir in the sesame oil, salt, sugar, and white pepper. Add in 5 drops of yellow food coloring, if using. The yellow food coloring gives the soup that rich restaurant-style yellow color but it is, of course, optional. Taste the soup, and adjust the seasoning if needed. Next add the cornstarch slurry; make sure the cornstarch and water is mixed well, as the cornstarch settles very quickly. Stir the soup continuously as you drizzle in the slurry, or you’ll get unpleasant clumps of cooked starch in your soup. Use more or less starch if you like a thicker or thinner soup. You can also add the starch in a couple small batches, let the soup simmer for a couple of minutes, then check to see if the consistency is to your liking. Now we’re ready for the most exciting part: the egg. This recipe calls for the egg to be slightly beaten, which results in both white and yellow egg swirls. The speed at which you stir the soup when adding the egg also determines whether you get large “egg flowers” or small egg flowers (i.e. swirly bits of egg). This is more a matter of personal preference than correctness. If you vary the speed at which you stir the soup, you’ll get both. Some people even prefer chunks of egg in their soup, so do whatever suits your preferences! Once the soup’s consistency is to your liking, use a ladle to stir the soup in a circular motion, and slowly drizzle in the egg until you have added it all.

Pour any remaining liquid in the wok into a measuring cup, and add water until you have a total of 1 cup of liquid. Add it to the mixing bowl with the cooked turnip. Clean your wok or pan and place it over medium heat. Add a couple tablespoons oil. Add the shrimp, mushrooms, and sausage, and cook for about 5 minutes. Stir in the chopped scallion and remove from the heat to cool. Add rice flour, cornstarch, salt, sugar, and white pepper to the mixing bowl with the radish and cooking liquid. Mix well until the dry ingredients are well-incorporated. Add in the cooked shrimp, mushrooms and sausage, and be sure to scrape the oil from the pan into the batter. Mix well and let sit for 15 minutes. Give the batter a final stir, and pour it into a well-oiled loaf pan. Place the pan into a steamer with plenty of water and steam over medium-high heat for 50 minutes. Remove the pan from the steamer and let your turnip cake set for about 30 minutes. Once cooled, loosen the sides with a spatula and turn it out onto a cutting board. It should come out quite easily. Use a sharp knife dipped in water to slice ½-inch thick pieces. I know people who’d enjoy it just like that, but most people pan-fry the turnip cake first. Add a couple tablespoons oil to a non-stick or seasoned cast iron pan over medium heat. Fry the cakes on both sides until golden and crispy. Serve with oyster sauce! Note: You can also make this turnip cake in advance, refrigerate it in the loaf pan, and slice/fry later.

See this recipe on the blog. Boil water in a large pot for the noodles. If using the lo mein egg noodles, you can skip this step, as those noodles do not require any pre-cooking. But if using fresh white noodles, you will have to boil them. Just cook until al dente, drain, and rinse in cold water. Set aside.",https://thewoksoflife.com,,,,4,,"1 pound (450g) fresh white noodles or lo mein egg noodles
1 tablespoon dark soy sauce
2 tablespoons light soy sauce
1 teaspoon sesame oil
1 teaspoon sugar + 1 teaspoon
hot water to dissolve the sugar in
pinch of five spice powder (optional)
1 tablespoon oil
1 clove garlic, minced
1 cup sliced mushrooms (shiitakes, button mushrooms, or anything you like)
1 scallion, split at the thick parts
and cut into 2-inch lengths
1 red, orange, or yellow bell pepper, julienned
1 small carrot, julienned
1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine
a handful snow peas, trimmed
a handful of leafy greens (bok
choy, choy sum, etc.)","In a small bowl, combine the soy sauces, sesame oil, dissolved sugar, and five spice powder, if using. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a wok over high heat and add the garlic, mushrooms, and the white parts of the scallions. Stir-fry for 30 seconds and add the peppers and carrots. Make sure your wok is searing hot, and then add the Shaoxing wine. Stir-fry for another minute. Next, add the snow peas and leafy greens to the wok and cook until the greens are just wilted. Then add your noodles. Make sure that before you add them, they’re somewhat loose and not all clumped together (you can rinse them in warm water to loosen them up before adding them to the wok). Pour your sauce mixture over the noodles and stir-fry until the color of the noodles are uniform. A folding or scoop-and-lift motion works well for that. Once everything is well-combined, dish out the noodles and serve.",chinese;quick;vegetarian,,,,,,,,,,,,,
