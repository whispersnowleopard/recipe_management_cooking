title: CHINESE BBQ PORK (CHAR SIU) Knowing
description: how to make good Chinese BBQ Pork (cha siu in Cantonese or cha shao in
  Mandarin) is a valuable skill to have. Not only does it mean you don’t have to travel
  to your local Chinese grocery or Cantonese restaurant to get it, you can freeze
  the leftovers for use in a host of different recipes, from BBQ Pork Buns and Pork
  Fried Rice to some of our other favorites, like Roast Pork Puffs. This pork is sweet
  and delicious, and our family’s recipe comes from Bill’s memories of his father
  (a chef) making it in restaurants. See this recipe on the blog. Cut the pork into
  long strips or chunks about 3 inches thick. Don’t trim any excess fat, as it will
  render off and add flavor.

ingredients:
- 3 pounds (1.4 kg) pork shoulder/
- pork butt (select a cut with some
- good fat on it)
- ¼ cup (50g) sugar
- 2 teaspoons salt
- ½ teaspoon five spice powder
- ¼ teaspoon white pepper
- ½ teaspoon sesame oil
- 1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine or Chinese plum wine
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon hoisin sauce
- 2 teaspoons molasses
- 1/8 teaspoon red food coloring (optional)
- 3 cloves finely minced garlic
- 2 tablespoons maltose or honey
- 1 tablespoon hot water
directions: Combine the sugar, salt, five spice powder, white pepper, sesame oil,
  wine, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, molasses, food coloring (if using), and garlic in
  a bowl to make the marinade (i.e. BBQ sauce). Reserve about 2 tablespoons of marinade
  and set it aside. Rub the pork with the rest of the marinade in a large bowl or
  baking dish. Cover and refrigerate overnight, or at least 8 hours. Cover and store
  the reserved marinade in the fridge as well. Preheat your oven to the highest setting
  (475-550 degrees F or 250-290 degrees C) with a rack positioned in the upper third
  of the oven. Line a sheet pan with foil and place a metal rack on top. Place the
  pork on the rack, leaving as much space as possible between pieces. Pour 1 ½ cups
  water into the pan below the rack. This prevents any drippings from burning or smoking.
  Transfer the pork to your preheated oven and roast for 25 minutes. After 25 minutes,
  flip the pork. If the bottom of the pan is dry, add another cup of water. Turn the
  pan 180 degrees to ensure even roasting. Roast another 15 minutes. Meanwhile, combine
  the reserved marinade with the maltose or honey (maltose is very viscous––you can
  heat it up in the microwave to make it easier to work with) and 1 tablespoon hot
  water. This will be the sauce you’ll use for basting the pork. After 40 minutes
  of total roasting time, baste the pork, flip it, and baste the other side as well.
  Roast for a final 10 minutes. After 50 minutes of total roasting time, the pork
  should be cooked through and caramelized on top. If it’s not caramelized to your
  liking, you can turn the broiler on for a couple minutes to crisp the outside and
  add some color/ flavor. Remove from the oven and baste with the last bit of reserved
  BBQ sauce. Let the meat rest for 10 minutes before slicing, and enjoy!
