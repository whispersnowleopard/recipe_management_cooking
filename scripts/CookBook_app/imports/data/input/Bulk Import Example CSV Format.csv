Butternut Squash Veggie Pizza,Main Course,"10-ingredient pizza that's perfect for late summer and fall. Butternut squash sauce adds a colorful, savory-sweet base, while broccolini, chickpeas, and onion add texture, fiber, and protein. A healthy, plant-based meal the whole family will enjoy.",https://minimalistbaker.com/butternut-squash-veggie-pizza/,15,45,60,8,8 slices,"3 cups butternut squash, cubed
3 cloves garlic, whole, skin removed
2 Tbsp olive oil, divided
Pinch sea salt + black pepper
1 Tbsp (15 ml) maple syrup
1 1/2 cups broccolini, chopped, large stems removed
1/2 cup red onion, chopped
optional: 1/2 cup cooked chickpeas, rinsed and thoroughly dried
Pinch sea salt + black pepper
1 tsp dried oregano
6 ounces store-bought pizza dough
1 cup Butternut Squash Sauce
1/2 cup vegan parmesan cheese, or store-bought vegan mozzarella cheese
Vegan parmesan cheese
Red pepper flakes","Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and position a rack in the middle of the oven.
Add cubed butternut squash and peeled garlic cloves to a baking sheet and drizzle with 1 Tbsp olive oil and a pinch each salt and pepper. Toss to combine.
Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until all squash is fork tender.
Transfer squash and garlic to a blender or food processor with remaining 1 Tbsp olive oil and maple syrup. Purée until creamy and smooth, adding more olive oil or a touch of water if it's too thick. The consistency should be creamy and spreadable (not pourable).
Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. Set aside.
Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add 1 tsp oil, broccolini, onion, chickpeas (optional), salt and pepper, and oregano. Sauté for 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently. Set aside.
Increase oven heat to 425 degrees F (218 C).
Roll out pizza dough into an even circle and transfer to a parchment-lined round baking sheet (or similarly-shaped object).
Top with ~ 1 cup sauce (you will have leftover sauce, which you can reserve for other pizzas), veggies, and chickpeas. Sprinkle on a bit more oregano and vegan parmesan cheese (or vegan mozzarella).
Transfer pizza to the oven, laying the pizza and parchment paper directly on oven rack (slide the baking sheet off so it can bake directly on the rack for a crispier crust). Bake for 13-18 minutes, or until crust edges are golden brown.
Slice and serve with remaining parmesan cheese, dried oregano, and red pepper flakes (optional). Leftovers keep well for 2-3 days, though best when fresh.",Dinner,4,https://plantoeat.s3.amazonaws.com/recipes/12959914/41f6e0c4e3d2ada198fc0c50c9a74ef2184be601-original.jpg?1510705733,171,6.4 g,,199 mg,4.1 g,24 g,2.2 g,6.2 g,,15/11/2017 0:28,15/11/2017 0:28
