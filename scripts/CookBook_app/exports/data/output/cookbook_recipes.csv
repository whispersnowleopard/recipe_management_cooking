Bring to a simmer, then lower heat, cover, and continue cooking until slightly thickened and fragrant — about 15-20 minutes. Turn the heat down if it’s boiling — you’re looking for a low simmer.
Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding salt to taste, additional peanut butter for depth of flavor and creaminess, chili garlic sauce for heat, or tomato paste for tomato flavor.
Serve as a stew, over rice, or with naan or pita. For a lighter option, serve over cauliflower rice or a bed of raw or steamed broccoli (which happens to be our favorite). Basil and cilantro are delicious finishing touches.

Add the tomatoes, pumpkin, coconut milk, broth (or water), salt, and pepper and stir well to combine. Bring to a simmer, cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer for ~20 minutes to develop the flavors. Taste and adjust as needed, adding more salt for overall flavor, allspice for warmth, or cayenne for heat (we added the full amount, but how much you add will depend on personal preference and the spiciness of your cayenne). Keep in mind the flavor will intensify the longer you cook it and after storing overnight.
At this point, you can either enjoy it a little chunky, purée with an immersion blender for a mostly smooth texture, or transfer to a heat-safe blender and blend until fully smooth and creamy. All three options are delicious, but if using diced tomatoes (rather than crushed), we recommend blending for a more cohesive/balanced tomato flavor!
Divide between serving bowls and garnish with fresh cilantro and toasted cashews (both optional). It’s delicious served with naan or grilled cheese sandwiches.
Leftover soup keeps well stored in a sealed container in the refrigerator for 3-4 days or in the freezer for 1 month (or longer).",17,5

¾ cup granulated sugar
2 Tbsp unsalted butter
3 large eggs, room temperature, beaten with a fork
1 tsp baking soda
3 cups all-purpose flour, I used unbleached, organic
Sour cream frosting ingredients:
32 oz sour cream
2 cups powdered sugar
1 cup heavy whipping cream
For the topping:
½ lb strawberries, optional","How to make the cake layers:
Add 3/4 cup sugar, 1/4 cup honey and 2 Tbsp unsalted butter to a medium sauce pan and melt them together over medium/low heat, whisking occasionally until sugar is melted (5-7 mins). Don't put them over high heat or they may scorch to the bottom.
As soon as the sugar is dissolved, remove from heat and while it's still hot, add in your beaten eggs in a slow steady stream while whisking vigorously until all of your eggs are incorporated (whisk constantly so you don't end up with scrambled eggs).
Whisk in the baking soda until no lumps remain, then fold in your 3 cups flour 1/2 cup at a time with a spatula until the dough reaches a clay consistency and doesn't stick to your hands. Mine took exactly 3 cups flour (measured precisely, scraping off the top of the cup).
Cut the dough into 8 equal pieces and move on to the next step right away (these roll out best when the dough is still warm)
On a well-floured surface, roll each piece out into a thin 9"" circle (about 1/8"" thick). You can sprinkle the top with a little flour too to keep dough from sticking to your rolling pin. Place a 9"" plate or base from a springform mold over your rolled dough and trace around it with a pizza cutter to get a perfect circle. Keep the scraps for later. Transfer the dough to a large sheet of parchment paper and bake 2 at a time at 350˚F for 4-5 minutes or until golden. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely before stacking. Repeat with remaining layers.
Finally bake the scraps separated evenly on a re-used sheet of parchment. Once the scraps are baked, cooled and firm, you can crush them with a rolling pin or pulse them in a food processor until you have fine crumbs.
How to make the frosting:
Beat 1 cup heavy cream until fluffy and stiff peaks form (1-2 min on high speed).
In a separate bowl, whisk together 32 oz sour cream with 2 cups powdered sugar. Fold the whipped cream into the sour cream and you have your frosting. Refrigerate until ready to use.
Assembling your cake:
Spread about 1/3 cup frosting on each cake layer (don't skimp on it since the cake needs to absorb some of the cream to become ultra soft. Press the cake layers down gently as you go to keep the layers from having air gaps. Frost the top and sides with the remaining frosting.
Dust the top and sides with your breadcrumbs, then cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. This cake needs time to absorb some of the cream and soften, so be patient. It's worth the wait!",10,13

1 Lime wedges

1 Warm corn tortillas","Place 1/4 cup long-grain white rice in a fine-mesh strainer and run under cold water until the water runs mostly clear. Place in a small saucepan, add 1/2 cup water, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat down to the lowest setting. Cover and cook until the rice is tender and the water is absorbed, about 10 minutes. Transfer the rice to a large bowl and let cool to room temperature.
Meanwhile, prepare the following, adding each to the same medium bowl as you complete it: Peel and dice 1 large carrot (about 1 cup). Dice 1 large celery stalk (about 1/2 cup). Dice 1 small white or yellow onion (about 1 cup).
Dice 2 medium Yukon gold potatoes and 2 medium roma tomatoes (no need to peel, about 1 1/2 cups each).
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a Dutch oven or large pot over medium heat until shimmering. Add the carrot mixture and sauté until the onion is translucent but not browned, about 6 minutes. Increase the heat to medium high, add 2 (32-ounce) cartons chicken broth, and bring to a simmer.
Meanwhile, add 1 pound lean ground beef, 2 tablespoons fine breadcrumbs, 1 large egg, 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper to the bowl of rice and mix until evenly combined. Form the mixture into 12 meatballs: Scoop out scant 1/4-cup portions of the mixture and roll each one with damp hands to form a smooth ball. Place on a plate.
Add the potatoes, tomatoes, meatballs, and 1 fresh oregano sprig or 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano to the simmering broth.

2 Tbsp tamarind juice, a.k.a. tamarind concentrate or tamarind paste
1 large white-flesh sweet potato, cut into big chunks, the orange flesh ones are not as good in this dish
½ a large onion, cut into ½-inch strips
¼ cup roasted peanuts
Jasmine rice for serving","Cut the beef off the bones and, if necessary, cut them down into large cubes.
In a heavy bottomed pot, add just enough oil to coat the bottom and heat over medium high heat until very hot. Without crowding the pot, sear the beef in the oil until well browned on 2 sides (or you can sear it on 3-4 sides if you have the patience). Do this in as many batches as necessary.
Once all the beef is seared, add it all back into the pot, along with the bones you removed.
Add ½ cup of coconut milk and just enough water to keep everything submerged. Add 1 tablespoon of the curry paste, 1 tablespoon fish sauce, and simmer gently for 2 - 2 ½ hours or until the beef is fork tender. Set it aside.
In another heavy bottomed pot (this will be your curry pot), add about ¾ cup of the remaining coconut milk and bring to a boil. Let it boil until reduced by about half, and the coconut milk looks significantly thicker.
Add the remaining curry paste and saute it in the coconut milk over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until the coconut oil separates from the paste (it will start to sizzle around the edges of the paste). If the paste sticks to the pot before it is ready, you can deglaze with a splash of the remaining coconut milk as needed.
Once the paste is ready, add the remaining coconut milk and stir to dissolve the paste. Add 1 tablespoon of the fish sauce, palm sugar and tamarind.
Using tongs, remove the beef from the braising liquid and add it to the curry pot, saving the cooking liquid. (Do not add the bones back in unless there's still meat on it that you want to eat.) Then add the onion, potato and peanuts to the curry.
Skim off the fat and scum from the beef cooking liquid, then add just enough of the liquid to the curry to keep everything submerged.
Bring the curry to a simmer the let it cook gently for another 10-15 minutes until the sweet potatoes are fork tender.
TASTE and adjust final seasoning with more fish sauce, sugar or tamarind as needed. This is very important because everyone will end up with a different amount of salt at this point depending on the saltiness of your curry paste and also how much cooking liquid you end up adding. So, TASTE.

In a mortar and pestle, pound julienned Thai basil into a fine paste. Add grachai and pound into a paste. Add the shrimp paste and green curry paste and pound to mix.
Alternatively, you can add the basil, grachai, and shrimp paste to a blender, and blend it with some of the chicken stock until smooth, and you'll just need to pour this into the curry with the rest of the stock.
For the green curry:
In a heavy-bottomed pot, bring about ¾ cup of the coconut milk to a full boil over medium heat. Add the curry paste and sauté, stirring frequently, until coconut oil starts to separate from the paste, 3-5 minutes. If the paste is super thick and no oil separation occurs, you can move on to the next step.
*If the paste sticks to the bottom of the pan, you can deglaze with a little bit of the remaining coconut milk or stock.
Add chicken thigh and stir to mix with the paste. (If using chicken breast, see modification below)
Add the chicken stock, remaining 1 cup of coconut milk, palm sugar and 1 Tablespoon of the fish sauce. Grab the makrut lime leaves and twist them to bruise and release aroma, then tear them into chunks and add them to the pot, discarding the center stems. Bring to a simmer and let simmer gently for 10-15 minutes or until the chicken is fork tender.
*The lime leaves are for infusion only and not meant to be eaten when left in large pieces. They are traditionally left in the curry, but be sure to inform your guests not to eat them.
Meanwhile, if using Thai eggplant, cut them into bite-sized pieces; this could mean cutting into 6,8, or even 12 pieces depending on the size. Keep them submerged in water if not using soon to prevent browning.
Once the chicken is done simmering, add the Thai eggplant and keep pushing them into the curry for the first minute as they will turn brown if left to float in the beginning, and then you can leave them to cook for 2 minutes longer until the eggplant can be pierced through with a fork with a little resistance. Do not let the eggplant overcook.
If using bamboo shoots, simply add them in and let them cook for a minute or so to heat up as they are already cooked (and they cannot be overcooked!)
Turn off the heat and add the red peppers and stir to mix, letting them cook gently in the residual heat. Then add the Thai basil and stir to mix. Taste and adjust seasoning with more of the fish sauce as needed. Serve with jasmine rice!
*If you feel that the curry is weak and needs more curry paste, saute the additional curry paste in some oil in a small pot for a few minutes until aromatic, then add about a cup of the curry sauce to dissolve the paste and let it simmer for a few minutes, then stir it back into the curry.
If using chicken breast:
Marinade the chicken in 1 tablespoon of fish sauce and let it sit while you make the curry. Follow instructions above but leave the chicken out until after the eggplant/bamboo shoots have been added. Add the chicken after the veg have been cooking for 1 minute, then let it to cook for about 2 minutes or until just done. Do not overcook.",14,12

1 Honey Butter Sauce
4 tablespoons melted butter
1 2–3 tablespoons honey
1 1–2 teaspoons Dijon mustard","Prep:
Cook the rice according to package directions. (I do this in a pressure cooker)
Toast the coconut:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Place panko and coconut on a baking sheet; toast for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until nice and golden brown. After your panko and coconut are toasted and out of the oven, bump up the oven temperature to 425 degrees.
Coat the coconut shrimp:
Make three bowls: one for the flour, paprika, and salt; one for the egg, and one for the toasted coconut. Coat individual shrimp in flour / spice mix, then egg, then press into the panko until the mixture sticks to the shrimp. (I usually do all the shrimp in the flour / spice mix first, and then do the egg / panko dip so it’s a bit cleaner). Place coated shrimp back on the baking sheet. Spritz or drizzle with oil.
Bake the coconut shrimp:
Bake shrimp at 425 for 10 minutes.
Finish the rice:
Add peas, lemon juice and zest, herbs, garlic, and butter into the hot rice and gently fluff with a fork to combine. The peas just need to get heated through.
Make the sauce:
Whisk the melted butter with the honey and Dijon mustard. (And add whatever else you like – red pepper flakes, chili paste, lemon, etc.)

Wrap the brisket tightly in foil, and return to the smoker until an internal temperature of 185f is reached. Remove brisket from the smoker, and cut into thick slices, about 3/4 inch. Then cut the slices again to form cubes. If there are large seams of fat, you may want to trim these out or discard – they will not have a pleasant mouthfeel.

⅓ cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar
1 ¹/³ cup lukewarm water
1 cup boiling water
¼ cup vegetable oil or grapeseed oil
1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt
4 large eggs, lightly beaten, 1 Tbsp reserved for egg wash
6 cups all-purpose or bread flour, 5-6, plus more as needed
For the onion filling:
6 tablespoon grapeseed or canola oil
4 large yellow onions, minced
2 teaspoons kosher salt
8 teaspoons poppy seeds","In a small bowl, combine the yeast, 1 tablespoon of the sugar, and the lukewarm water. Stir and set aside. In a large bowl or in the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the remaining ⅓ cup sugar, the boiled water, oil, and salt. Stir until the sugar has dissolved. Add the beaten eggs, pour in the yeast mixture, and stir to combine.
Add the flour 1 cup at a time. Start by stirring with a fork, then switch to kneading by hand or using the stand mixer fitted with the dough hook. Add more flour as needed to avoid a sticky dough. Knead the dough until it is soft and pliable, pulls away from the sides of the bowl and bounces back when you poke it with your finger. Transfer the dough to a clean bowl and cover with a kitchen towel. Let rise in a warm place for at least 2 hours, or until the dough has doubled in size.
While the dough is rising, prepare the onion filling. In a large frying pan, heat the oil over medium-low heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring often, until they are shrunken and slightly caramelized, about 10-15 minutes. Remove from the heat, stir in the poppy seeds and salt. Split the mixture in half, in two separate bowls (one for each challah loaf) and set aside.
When the dough has risen, punch it down and split in half. Separate each half into three, even-sized pieces. Roll each piece into a long, thick strand (as you would with a regular challah strand). One by one, on a flour-dusted surface, flatten each strand with a rolling pin. Distribute onion and poppy mixture on the center of the dough strand, leaving a perimeter of dough around the filling. Fold over lengthwise, sealing the ends together with tines of a fork so that your onions and poppy seeds are wrapped up in a long dough bundle. Repeat this process with all 3 strands and braid the strands tightly into a loaf. It can be a bit messy, but allow any loose onion-poppy mixture to find its way onto the dough while braiding. For those who want a bit more of a challenge (and a more dramatic challah), separate each ball of dough into 6 pieces, fill the six challah strands as above, and use the 6-braid method to form a challah, folding it up tightly. Repeat the process with the remaining piece of dough to form a second challah. When you’ve braided your loaves, place on a parchment lined sheet tray and brush with egg wash. (Alternatively, roll out strands of dough, fill them as described above, and tie them into knots for sandwich rolls.)
Set aside the loaves to rise for 45 minutes, as it puffs up again. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350F. Bake the challah for 35 to 40 minutes, on the middle rack of the oven. At 30 minutes, check the challah by (carefully) lifting each one up and tapping the bottom with a knuckle. If it sounds hollow and the outside of the challah is a brownish color, it’s ready. If it sounds completely solid or is still pale in color or doughy in the places where the braids meet, bake for 5 minutes more and test again. Remove the loaves from the oven and let cool on a wire rack. Serve warm or at room temperature. The Bialy Challah lasts for a few days due to the moisture from the oil and onions. Bialy challah freezes well (wrap in foil, then place in a freezer bag). Just thaw and reheat slightly before serving.",12,5

½ teaspoon sweet paprika
½ teaspoon smoked paprika
¼ teaspoon coriander powder
⅛ teaspoon cayenne, optional, if you want it spicy
1 teaspoon dried thyme, crushed with your fingers
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 small onion, quartered and sliced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 block extra firm tofu, 12 to 14 oz
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 teaspoon salt
1 Fresh black pepper
½ cup cherry or grape tomatoes, sliced in half, I used sungolds
Scallions for garnish
For the grits:
1 cup polenta corn grits, such as Bob’s Red Mill brand
4 cups vegetable broth
¼ teaspoon salt, to taste, depending how salty your broth is
1 tablespoon olive oil
4 cloves garlic, minced","To make the tofu:
Combine the spice blend in a small cup or bowl.
Preheat a large, heavy bottom pan over medium high heat. Saute the onion in olive oil for about a 5 minutes, then add the garlic and stir for 30 seconds.
Break the tofu apart into bite sized pieces and saute for about 10 minutes, using a spatula to stir often. Get under the tofu when you are stirring, scrape the bottom and don’t let it stick to the pan, that is where the good, crispy stuff is. Use a thin metal spatula to get the job done, a wooden or plastic one won’t really cut it. The tofu should get browned on at least one side, but you don’t need to be too precise about it. The water should cook out of it and not collect too much at the bottom of the pan. If that is happening, turn the heat up and let the water evaporate.
Add the lemon juice, salt and pepper and saute a minute more. Add the spice blend and mix to incorporate. Add the tomatoes and cook until they are warmed through and slightly broken down, about 5 minutes. Taste for salt and seasoning and keep warm until ready to serve.
To make the polenta:
Bring vegetable broth and salt to a boil in a 2 quart pot. Lower heat to simmer. Add the polenta in a slow steady stream, stirring constantly with a whisk. Whisk for about 5 minutes, until polenta is thickened. Keeping heat low, cover and let cook for 20 more minutes or so, stirring occasionally.
When polenta is almost done, preheat a small pan over medium-low heat. Saute the garlic in oil just until it begins to sizzle, being careful not to burn. Stir for 30 seconds, then transfer to the cooked polenta and mix well.
To serve:
Spoon some polenta onto a plate and scoop on some tofu, overlapping a bit. Complete the plate with greens, then garnish with scallion.",19,10

½ teaspoon ground black pepper
1 tablespoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon ground cumin
½ to 1 teaspoon Kashmiri chili powder, or cayenne, tweak to your taste
½ teaspoon turmeric
1 tablespoon rice flour, or all-purpose flour
Salt to taste
2 tablespoon cilantro, minced","Roast the sabut urad:
Rinse the sabut urad in a strainer and let all water drain out.
Heat a sauté pan or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the washed urad to the pan and roast it until it is aromatic, about five minutes. Remove the urad to a plate or bowl and let it cool to room temperature. Place the urad in a blender and blend into a coarse powder - it shouldn't be a flour, but you shouldn't have any large pieces or whole beans either.
Make chaunsa dal:
Heat oil in the same pan over high heat. If using mustard oil, wait until the oil starts to smoke. Add mustard seeds and when they sputter, add the asafetida and the onions along with a bit of salt. Sauté the onions until they begin to turn color.
Lower heat to medium and add the ginger garlic paste, ground black pepper, ground cumin, ground coriander, turmeric and Kashmiri chili powder or cayenne. Mix and stir for about a minute to toast the spices lightly.
Add the rice flour to the pan and mix it in.
Stir in the powdered urad and sauté for a couple of minutes. Begin trickling in the water, a little at a time, mixing all the time so lumps don't form. After you've added a cup of water you should have a thick paste. Continue adding water, a cup at a time, until you've added a total of five cups of water. This might seem like a lot but the dal will absorb the water and thicken quite a bit as it cooks.
Bring the dal to a boil, then turn heat to a simmer, cover the pan and let the lentils cook, 30-40 minutes or until they are soft and quite thick. Stir the dal frequently because the lentils have a tendency to sink to the bottom of the pan, especially before they have cooked.
Once the dal has cooked and is quite tender and creamy, add salt to taste. Chaunsa dal is not meant to be tangy but if you want a bit of tang you can squeeze in some lemon juice at this point. Garnish with cilantro and serve the dal hot.",14,10

Rub the marinade ingredients into the chicken with your hands until all the liquid has been absorbed by the chicken. Set aside for 10 minutes.
Next, prepare the sauce mixture. In a small bowl or measuring cup, add the warm chicken stock, sugar, soy sauce, dark soy sauce , oyster sauce, sesame oil and white pepper. Stir everything together until well combined and set aside.
Boil water in your wok and blanch the broccoli for 1 minute (or 2 minutes if you like your broccoli softer). Drain and set aside.
Clean and dry your wok. Place it over high heat until smoking. Add 2 tablespoons vegetable oil and sear the chicken until opaque on all sides (this shoul d only take about 3 minutes). Turn off the heat, remove the chicken, and set aside. The chicken will be about 90% done, but will be cooked again at the end.
Without washing the wok, set the flame to medium heat. Add another tablespoon of oil, along with the garlic and ginger (if using). Stir the garlic and ginger for 5 seconds and add the Shaoxing wine around the perimeter of the wok. Then pour in the sauce mixture. Use your wok spatula to stir the sauce around the sides of the wok to deglaze, and let it come to a simmer.
Stir up the cornstarch and water slurry and drizzle the mixture into sauce while stirring constantly. Allow the sauce to simmer for 10 to 15 seconds until thick and gravy-like.
Toss in the chicken and its juices and the blanched broccoli. Stir-fry until the chicken and broccoli is coated in the sauce.
At this point, you can make adjustments. If you like your brown sauce darker, add a dash more of dark soy sauce. Add more cornstarch slurry if your sauce is too thin, or more chicken stock or water if the sauce is too thick. Serve with steamed rice.",18,8

1 large stalk celery, about 3 ounces
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon kosher salt, divided, plus more as needed
1 carton low-sodium chicken broth, 32-ounce
1 cup water
¾ cup all-purpose flour
½ rotisserie chicken, or 2 cups shredded, cooked chicken, about 1 pound
2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill or parsley leaves
1 Freshly ground black pepper","Step 1:
Place 2 large eggs on the counter and let sit at room temperature while you prepare the vegetables.
Step 2:
Prepare the following, adding each to the same medium bowl as you complete it: Dice 1 small and 1/2 medium yellow onion (about 1 cup). Peel and halve 2 medium carrots, then cut crosswise into 1/3-inch pieces (about 3/4 cup). Halve 1 large celery stalk lengthwise, then cut crosswise into 1/3-inch pieces (about 2/3 cup).
Step 3:
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a medium Dutch oven or large saucepan over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the onion mixture (reserve the bowl) and season with 1/2 teaspoon of the kosher salt. Cook, stirring often, until the vegetables are beginning to soften and are fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes.
Step 4:
Add 1 (32-ounce) carton low-sodium chicken broth and 1 cup water, and stir to combine. Bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium-low to maintain a gentle simmer and cook for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, crack the eggs into the now-empty bowl and whisk until very smooth. Add 3/4 cup all-purpose flour and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and stir until smooth with a spatula or fork.
Step 5:
Dip a small metal spoon into the simmering broth. Use the hot spoon to scoop a small amount of the batter (about 1 teaspoon) in the shape of a football. Dunk the whole spoon with the batter into the broth to release the “clunker.” Continue with the remaining batter, you should have about 30 clunkers. If the batter starts to stick to the spoon, dip the spoon in broth before doing the next scoop.
Step 6:
Simmer the clunkers until they are cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes. Meanwhile, shred the meat of 1/2 rotisserie chicken into bite-sized pieces (discard the skin and bones) if needed. Coarsely chop a few sprigs fresh dill or fresh parsley leaves until you have 2 tablespoons.
Step 7:
Add the chicken to the soup, stir to combine, and return to a simmer. Taste the broth and season with more kosher salt or black pepper as needed. Add the dill or parsley and stir to combine. Ladle into bowls and serve hot.",12,14

Mix 1/3 cup of hot water or chicken stock with cornstarch into a slurry and set aside. If you like more sauce for the rice, increase your hot water/stock and add more salt or soy sauce to taste.
Heat the wok over high heat until smoking, add a tablespoon of oil to coat the wok and spread the chicken around evenly. Let the chicken sear (don’t move the pieces) for about 60 seconds until browned on one side. If the wok is heated properly, the chicken should not stick. Next, give the chicken a quick stir and add the minced garlic and snow peas.
Add the shaoxing wine around the rim of the wok to deglaze and stir everything together using a bottom to top folding motion for about 30 seconds.
Movement is important for the snow peas to cook evenly. The pods should be just starting to turn bright green now. Working quickly, add soy sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil, salt, pepper, and sugar. Stir to combine, about 15 seconds.
Stir up your slurry mix (the water and starch has probably separated by now) and add to the wok. Stir-fry for another 30 seconds, or until the sauce is thick enough to coat a spoon. All of the pea pods should be bright green by now. Don’t overcook or you precious pea pods will become limp and turn yellow!

Trim the fat from the chicken thighs, if you want. Then toss the chicken with the spices and olive oil. You want them to be nicely coated with the spices.

Heat the olive oil in a skillet or grill pan (affiliate link) over medium high heat. Grill or saute the chicken, flipping once, until nice and browned on both sides with an internal temperature of 165 degrees. (See notes for alternate cooking methods.)
Make the sauce:
While the chicken is cooking, use a mini-chopper (affiliate link) or food processor to pulse the pistachios, cilantro, and chives until finely chopped.
Finish sauce:
Add to a bowl with the avocado chunks, lemon juice and zest, olive oil, and salt. Stir it up – it’ll be thick, chunky, and a little bit irresistible.
Serve:
Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces (makes it easier to build a bowl and eat)! Season with salt. Top with spoonfuls of the chunky pistachio sauce. I love this with rice and a salad. The flavors!! So good.",11,10

1 envelope of Lipton Beefy-Onion soup mix
1 cup of drained bean sprouts from a can
½ cup of sliced water chestnuts, diced
2 packages of original crescent rolls","First, brown the ground beef in a large skillet. Make sure thoroughly browned. Drain off the fat.

Add the contents of one envelope of the soup mix sprinkled over all the meat and stir until coated. Then add bean sprouts and sliced water chestnuts.

Let the meat mix cool spread out on a large plate.

Put down a large piece of wax paper on the counter and sprinkle it with flour to provide a surface for the crescent rolls. Open one of the crescent rolls. Inside you will find two sections of two triangles each. Take one section of two triangles, separate them, and then slice each triangle in half to make two more triangles out of each. You now have four triangles. 

When the meat mix is cooled, add one teaspoon of the meat mix to each triangle, one at a time, and pull the corners of each triangle up to each other, close the edges, and roll into a ball. Put each ball on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. Repeat this process for each section of crescent rolls. At the end you will have 32 Chodrocks after using both packages of crescent rolls.

If you want to do this in advance of Thanksgiving day, as I do, you can cover the cookie sheet with first a layer of parchment paper, then a layer of aluminum foil and put in freezer.

Take the tray out an hour before you want to cook the Chodrocks on Thanksgiving day. Preheat oven to 375, and cook the Chodrocks for 15-20 minuets, until the dough turns golden brown. And wallah, you are ready to serve!!",5,1

1 8.8-ounce pouch pre-made yellow rice, or make your own!
1 14-ounce can refried or regular black beans
1–2 cups diced pineapple, mango, and/or avocado, optional","If you’re using wood skewers, start soaking them!
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil. Turn on the broiler, and make sure one of the oven racks is way up at the top, about 6 inches from the heating element.
Place chicken in a large mixing bowl.
Combine the sauce ingredients in a small bowl.
Pour only half of the sauce over the chicken and toss to coat; reserve the other half of the sauce for later. Thread the chicken pieces onto skewers, or you can just let the excess sauce drip off and add the chicken directly to your sheet pan! If you want (I do!) season the chicken with a little pinch of extra salt.
Broil for 12 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through and has a burnished and golden exterior.
Optional – mix a little bit of the reserved sauce with the diced pineapple/mango/avocado to make a little “salsa.”
Brush the golden brown chicken with reserved sauce. Serve chicken with rice, beans, and your fruit salsa! Fresh, juicy and savory, so good.",12,8

6 tablespoons unsalted butter, 3/4 stick
1 Cooking spray
2 ¼ cups cake flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
½ teaspoon kosher salt
¾ cup granulated sugar
2 large eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
½ cup whole or 2 % milk
2 cups fresh blueberries, divided, about 12 ounces
For the streusel topping and optional glaze:
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, 1/2 stick
1 medium lemon
½ cup granulated sugar
½ cup cake flour
¼ teaspoon kosher salt
½ cup powdered sugar, optional","For the buckle:
Cut butter into cubes and prepare the baking pan. Cut 6 tablespoons unsalted butter into small cubes, then place in a stand mixer and let sit at room temperature to soften, about 15 minutes. (Alternatively, place in a large bowl if using an electric hand mixer.) Meanwhile, arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to 375°F. Coat an 8-inch square baking pan with cooking spray, then line with a parchment paper sling so that it hangs off two sides. Prepare the streusel.
For the streusel topping and optional glaze:
Melt the butter for the streusel. Microwave 4 tablespoons unsalted butter in a small microwave-safe bowl in 10-second intervals until melted, about 40 seconds total.
Zest the lemon and rub into the sugar for the streusel. Finely grate the zest of 1 medium lemon (about 1 tablespoon). Reserve the zested lemon for the icing. Place the zest and 1/2 cup granulated sugar in a medium bowl, and rub together with your fingers until very fragrant and the consistency of wet sand.
Make the streusel. Add 1/2 cup cake flour and 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt to the lemon sugar and stir with a spatula until combined. Add the melted butter and stir until no flour remains and the mixture is crumbly. Freeze or refrigerate until chilled, 10 to 15 minutes.
Make the buckle:
Mix the dry ingredients. Place 2 1/4 cups cake flour, 2 teaspoons baking powder, and 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt in a medium bowl and whisk to combine.
Cream the butter and sugar. Add 3/4 cup granulated sugar to the stand mixer. Beat with the paddle attachment on medium speed until lightened in color, about 4 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.
Make the buckle batter. With the mixer on low speed, beat in 2 large eggs one at a time, waiting until the first is completely incorporated before adding the second. Add 2 teaspoons vanilla extract and beat until combined. Add half of the flour mixture and beat until mostly incorporated. Add 1/2 cup whole or 2% milk and beat until just combined. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl. Return the mixer to low speed, add the remaining flour mixture, and mix until just combined. (The dough will be thick, so if using a hand mixer, mix in the remaining flour mixture by hand with a sturdy spatula.)
Fold in the blueberries. Add 1 cup of the blueberries and fold in by hand with a rubber spatula.
Transfer to pan and add blueberries.Transfer the batter to the prepared baking pan and smooth the top. Sprinkle the remaining 1 cup blueberries evenly onto the batter.
Top with streusel. Crumble the chilled streusel in large pieces evenly over the top.
Bake the buckle. Bake until the cake is lightly browned and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes.
Cool the buckle. Place the pan on a wire rack and cool for 15 minutes. Grasping the parchment paper, remove the cake from the pan to the wire rack and let cool completely. Prepare the glaze, if desired.
Make the optional glaze and serve:
Make the lemon glaze. Juice the reserved lemon (about 2 tablespoons). Place 1/2 cup powdered sugar in a small bowl, add 1 tablespoon of the lemon juice, and stir with a spatula until smooth. If needed, stir in 1 to 2 teaspoons more lemon juice until the glaze is a pourable consistency.
Drizzle glaze over buckle and serve. Drizzle the cooled blueberry buckle with the lemon glaze. Let sit until the glaze sets, about 15 minutes. Cut into squares and serve.",16,18

The total cooking time does not include the time required for roasting the butternut squash and making the butternut squash puree. I recommend that you do that in advance.
Because you will be roasting whole butternut squash, you will have more than you need (1 cup) for this recipe. Refrigerate or freeze the leftover butternut squash puree in an airtight container.

You can use either fresh or dried thyme

Use 2 tablespoons of thyme leaves (no sprigs) if using fresh thyme. Half for the sauce, half for sprinkling on top as garnish.
If using dried thyme, use ½ teaspoon of dried leaves (not powdered) or ¼ teaspoon of powdered dried thyme.

Creamy Butternut Squash and Coconut Noodle Soup,"Sweet, savory, and full of flavor, this easy weeknight noodle soup takes a cue from the warmly comforting northern Thai dish khao soi, with a curry-spiced coconut broth and toppings that offer crunch and contrast. First, the butternut squash is simmered in the fragrant broth until very tender. Then the squash is mashed, becoming one with the coconut milk before stock and sweet and savory seasonings are added (to keep the soup vegetarian, use soy sauce instead of fish sauce and use vegan curry paste). You can use any type of egg noodles here, from wide dried egg noodles to flat fresh egg noodles (sometimes labeled as wonton noodles). Ladle the flavorful squash broth over the noodles and garnish with as much garnish as your heart and stomach desires. Those toppings can be — but are not limited to — a lot of lime juice to cut the richness, cilantro, sliced fresh shallots, crispy shallots, fried noodles, chile oil or pickled mustard greens.",4 servings,https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1026109-creamy-butternut-squash-and-coconut-noodle-soup,https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1026109-creamy-butternut-squash-and-coconut-noodle-soup?algo=combo_cooking_rec4u_bert_unique_60_specialdiets_20_top_conv_save_decay_30day_0.8_click&campaign_id=333&emc=edit_ckfy_20251025&fellback=false&imp_id=6924684702187466&instance_id=165151&nl=your-recipe-recommendations&pool=cooking-rec4u-ls&regi_id=100587641&req_id=4220204413738826&segment_id=209329&surface=cooking-email-rec4u&user_id=7cde6293cffa46b798d7160c14dc5491&variant=0_bert_unique_save_decay_30da,10.0,25.0,35.0,,"The information shown is Edamam’s estimate based on available ingredients and preparation.

We made it according to the instructions, and we’re not disappointed. If I were in a rush, buying the squash cut up from a place like Trader Joe might help. Also, we’re thinking that shrimp or left over roasted chicken might be nice way to add protein. If I did that, I’d reduce the pasta that I add. Highly recommend trying this meal!Is this helpful? 274Sarah9 months agoI made this tonight - using half the recipe - and it was delicious! I love butternut squash soup, and this was a wonderful change from the usual. I used wide egg noodles and green curry paste, both of which I had on hand. Red curry paste may give it a bit more zing, or you can add more chili oil. The soup was very comforting and filling with a mild taste that was exactly right on a chilly night. I recommend plenty of lime juice to liven it up.Is this helpful? 224Cassandra Kessler1 day agoI have one average sized butternut squash.

3 cloves garlic
1 piece ginger, 1/2-inch
1 medium lime
2 tablespoons plain Greek yogurt
1 tablespoon tomato paste
1 ¾ teaspoons kosher salt, divided
½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
½ teaspoon ground turmeric
½ teaspoon ground cumin
½ teaspoon ground coriander
½ teaspoon garam masala
¼ teaspoon chili powder
4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, about 1 3/4 pounds total
3 large eggs
3 cups panko breadcrumbs
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup vegetable oil, divided","Make the mango chutney coleslaw:
Halve 1/4 small head red cabbage through the core, discard any wilted outer leaves, and cut out the core. Thinly slice crosswise into fine shreds (about 3 cups). Place in a large bowl. Repeat with 1/4 small head green cabbage.
Peel and grate 2 medium carrots on the large holes of a box grater. Thinly slice 1/2 medium red onion. (Alternatively, the cabbages, carrots, and onions can be run through a food processor fitted with the shredding blade.) Add the carrots and onions to the cabbages and toss to combine.
Pick the leaves from 1 medium bunch fresh cilantro until you have 3/4 tightly packed cup. Coarsely chop and add to the bowl.
Juice 1 medium lime into a small bowl until you have 1 tablespoon. Add 1/2 cup mayonnaise, 2 tablespoons mango chutney, 1 teaspoon kosher salt, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, and whisk to combine.
Pour over the cabbage mixture and toss gently to combine, making sure all the shreds are coated evenly. Taste and season with more lime juice, kosher salt, and black pepper as needed. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.
Make the curried chicken schnitzel:
Mince 3 garlic cloves (1 1/2 teaspoons). Peel and mince 1 (1/2-inch) piece ginger until you have 1 1/2 teaspoons. Place both in a large bowl. Juice 1 medium lime into the bowl (about 2 tablespoons).
Add 2 tablespoons Greek yogurt, 1 tablespoon tomato purée, 1 teaspoon of the kosher salt, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, 1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric, 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin, 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander, 1/2 teaspoon garam masala, and 1/4 teaspoon chili powder, and whisk to combine.
Pound 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts: Working with 1 at a time, place it inside a gallon zip-top bag. Using the flat side of a meat mallet or rolling pin, pound until 1/4-inch thick. Place in the marinade as each is completed.
Using your hands, rub the marinade into the chicken. Cover and refrigerate for a minimum of 8 hours, preferably overnight.
Remove the chicken from the refrigerator up to 1 hour before cooking. Meanwhile, prepare the breading.
Place 3 large eggs and 1/4 teaspoon of the kosher in a shallow bowl, such as a pie plate, and beat until the eggs are broken up. Place 3 cups panko breadcrumbs and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt in a second shallow bowl. Place 1 cup all-purpose flour in a third shallow bowl.
Heat 1/2 cup of the vegetable oil in a 12-inch straight-sided skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add 2 pieces of the chicken and fry until golden-brown and cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a clean plate. Add the remaining 1/2 cup vegetable oil to the pan, heat until shimmering, and repeat frying the remaining 2 chicken breasts. Serve with the mango chutney coleslaw.
Bread the chicken one piece at a time:
Dip into the flour until evenly coated, then shake off the excess. Place in the egg mixture and turn until evenly coated, then let the express drip off. Place in the breadcrumbs and turn until evenly coated. Place in a single layer on a baking sheet.",27,16

Dak Bulgogi (Korean BBQ Chicken),"One great joy of bulgogi, marinated grilled beef that translates to “fire meat,” is that you can prepare it in advance and, when you’re ready to eat, have dinner on the table in under 10 minutes.

 happy Monday my friend,
Sure looks like a good dish. While I’m not too fond about sausage, Gail is very beneficial to anyone’s health, especially men. Kale is good because it contains necessary nutrients and has estrogen blocking properties that helps men naturally raise testosterone levels. It’s also a great vegetable for men to eat regularly to help them lose weight and balance hormones.I grew up in Brooklyn and know all about good Italian food, especially I don’t recall ever had a day of my life, delicious rigatoni made fresh from scratch. This looks like a delicious meal anyone can put together thanks to your inspiring blog here! 🙂 🙂 🙂

You can use spicy or mild chilies, or a combination, depending on how spicy you want to make the dish. For mild, I use guajillo or puya, and for spicy I use arbol chilies or the small dried chilies sold at Asian markets. If you want it a little spicy but not sure how much to add, use 1 spicy chili to be safe, and you can always add more to the finished dish.
2. You can buy premade tamarind paste from Thailand, also labelled as “Tamarind Concentrate.” Make sure it is from Thailand and that it is a brown, pourable paste. You can also make your own tamarind paste from a block of tamarind pulp.
3. You may or may not need the lime depending on how tart your tamarind paste is.

Check doneness by lifting the noodles up with your fingers and they should be completely limp, have no resistance to gravity, and no longer retain their old shape. If you’re in a rush, you can use warm water and it’ll shorten the soaking time, but be careful not to over-soak (see more noodle soaking tips in the blog post above).
Remove seeds from the chilies by using scissors to cut them into chunks and allowing the seeds to pour out. No need to remove every last seed, whatever comes out is fine. Grind the chilies in a coffee grinder into a fine powder. If you don’t have a coffee grinder, you can cut and soak the chilies in room temp water until rehydrated (about 30 mins), then pound in a mortar and pestle into a paste.

Add the palm sugar and cook until mostly dissolved, about 30 seconds. Then add the tamarind sauce mixture and bring to a boil.
Add the shrimp (if using) and cook them in sauce for 1 minute, flipping them halfway through, just until they are done. Turn off the heat and remove the shrimp, leaving all the sauce behind.

Turn off the heat and taste the noodles, and if they are still too chewy, add a splash of water, and turn the heat back on and keep cooking until all the additional water has all been absorbed. Keep checking and adding water until the noodles are cooked through but still maintain a slight chew. (There are many factors that affect how much water you need to add, so it's okay if you end up adding a lot more or none at all, as long as the noodles are properly cooked.)
Once the noodles are cooked, add the beansprouts, garlic chives, cooked shrimp and most of the crab (if using), leaving a bit of crab behind for garnish. Turn off the heat and toss everything until just until the beansprouts are wilted.

0.1 teaspoon five spice powder
1 tablespoon oil
For the mandarin pancakes:
1.5 cups all purpose flour
0.1 teaspoon salt
0.66 cup boiling water
1 teaspoon oil
For the fixings:
1 cucumber, de-seeded and julienned
0.5 cup cantaloupe, julienned, optional
2 scallions, julienned
3 cloves garlic, finely minced and mixed with 1 teaspoon oil to make a paste, optional
3 tablespoons hoisin sauce","Marinate the duck:
Mix the salt, soy sauce, wine, and five spice powder in a small bowl and massage into the duck. Leave the duck breasts skin side up on a plate uncovered, and let sit in the refrigerator overnight to marinate and to let the skin dry out. (If you don't want to wait overnight, reduce the marinating time to 30 minutes).
Prepare mandarin pancakes:
Mix the flour and salt in a heatproof bowl. Pour the boiling hot water into the flour mixture and use chopsticks or a spatula to mix until a dough ball forms. Once it is cool enough to handle, knead the dough for 8 minutes until smooth, adding flour if the dough is too sticky. Cover with plastic and allow the dough to rest at room temperature for at least 1 hour.
Roll the dough into a cylinder and cut into 12 equal pieces. Form each piece into a dough ball, then flatten them out into a small disc about 2 inches in diameter. Lightly brush 6 of the discs with oil, ensuring the sides of the discs are also brushed with oil. Layer the remaining 6 discs over the 6 oiled discs so you have 6 pieces, each comprised of 2 discs.
Use a rolling pin to roll the discs into 7-inch circles, flipping the pancakes frequently so both of the dough discs are rolled into the same size.
Heat a wok or frying pan over medium low heat, and place one pancake into the pan. After 30 to 45 seconds, you should see air pockets begin to form between the two pancakes. Flip the pancake; it should be white with just a couple of faint brown patches. Any more than that, and they are overcooked. After another 30 seconds, the air pockets should be large enough to separate the two pancakes. Remove the pancake to a plate, and let it cool for another 30 seconds. Now carefully pull apart the two pancakes at the seams. Place finished pancakes onto a plate and cover with a warm kitchen towel. Repeat until all pancakes are done.
The pancakes can be reheated in a steamer for about a minute when ready to serve. They also keep in the freezer for up to 3 weeks if you decide to make a larger batch.
Cook the duck and assemble:
Next, preheat the oven broiler on low heat. Heat an oven-proof pan over medium-high heat, and add 1 tablespoon of oil to coat the pan.
Sear the duck breasts, skin side down, for 6-8 minutes. Move them frequently so the skin crisps up and fries in the duck fat that renders out. Turn the heat down to medium if needed.
After 6-8 minutes, or when the duck skin is a bit crispy and dark golden brown, carefully drain off the duck fat and discard (or save for later application to other recipes!). Flip the duck breasts (so they are skin side up), and transfer them to the broiler for about 3 minutes. Be careful not to burn the skin, which at this point should be a bit crispy.
Remove the duck from the broiler and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes. The duck will be cooked about medium well and will be very juicy. Transfer to a cutting board and, using a sharp knife, cut into thin slices.
Serve the duck with your warmed pancakes, fixings, and sauce.",15,14

¼ cup bacon or pancetta or cooked sausage, optional
¼ cup shredded cheddar cheese, see FAQs for more cheese options
1 few shakes of garlic powder
½ – 1 teaspoon salt
½ cup spinach, torn or cut into small pieces, optional
2 ounces of cheddar cheese to put on top, for extra cheesy-golden-brown spots

3 cloves garlic, sliced into thin pieces

¼ cup goat cheese
1 avocado
¼ cup romesco sauce, store-bought – see notes – or homemade
2 tablespoons chives
2 tablespoons hot sauce","Prepare your peppers and garlic confit. Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the peppers and sauté until brown and very soft, stirring only occasionally so you get some nice browning on them. I usually cook them for 20-30 minutes. During the last 10-15 minutes, add in the garlic with the peppers to get it nice and golden and soft (just make sure you don’t burn it). During the last 5 minutes, add the vinegar to add some zip and pull up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan.
Mix the base ingredients together for your egg waffles.
Pour about 1/2-3/4 cup onto a nonstick waffle maker (affiliate link) (depending on the size of yours). I usually spray mine with cooking spray, but that isn’t always necessary if the nonstick is really good.
Place the cheese chunks on top and put the lid down. When the light goes off to signal that it’s done, check that the eggs are cooked, veggies are soft, and cheese is golden on top. Remove carefully to a plate. (Mine is usually golden with soft veggies in just 1-2 minutes, but if yours isn’t done yet, just flip it or give it another minute.)
Top with all your toppings! I like goat cheese and peppers and garlic confit, romesco, avocado, chives, and lots of salt and pepper. My little girls like ketchup. We all win!",18,5
Eggplant Adobo,"This superpunchy, one-skillet vegetarian meal is inspired by chicken adobo, a beloved Filipino dish. Here, eggplant cooks in rich, tangy adobo sauce — a blend of soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, black pepper and bay leaf — absorbing the savory flavors as it simmers. Coconut milk is added in some versions of adobo, creating a rich, silky texture to balance out the sauce’s tart notes. This recipe includes a shower of fragrant basil, which brings a fresh hit that lifts the dish. (Thinly sliced scallions would also be great.)

Ethiopian Shiro Wot (Spicy Ground Chickpea Stew),This silky vegan Ethiopian Shiro Wot is so simple to make. It's also intensely aromatic and one of the most delicious chickpea stews ever! A homemade berbere spice blend and vegan niter kibbeh add amazing flavor.,8 servings,https://holycowvegan.net/ethiopian-shiro-wot-ground-chickpea-stew/,https://holycowvegan.net/ethiopian-shiro-wot-ground-chickpea-stew/,10.0,30.0,40.0,,"Helpful hints
Caramelizing the onions until they are brown and very soft will ensure they simply melt into the shiro, which is what you want for the perfect texture.
Add more berbere and niter kibbeh, if you want, to adjust the flavor to your liking.
Sift the chickpea flour into the saucepan to make sure there are no lumps.
Make sure the water you add to the chickpea paste is very hot, to ensure the cooking process doesn't stop, which it will if you add cold water that has to heat back up.
Use a whisk to mix in the water with the chickpea flour so there are no lumps.
Shiro is sold in Ethiopian stores as a premade mix of chickpea flour and berbere. If you use store bought shiro, you can skip mixing in the berbere but follow the rest of the instructions.
Storage instructions
Refrigerate: Store shiro in the fridge in an airtight container for up to four days.
Freeze: Freeze leftovers for up to four months.
Reheat: Thaw and reheat in the microwave or on the stovetop until warmed through. If needed add a bit of water.",False,False,0,,,111.0,8.0,1.0,8.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,,,"1 medium red onion, finely diced

Bring the shiro to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and let it cook 10-15 minutes until the chickpea flour has lost its raw flavor, the shiro has thickened, and little droplets of oil can be seen on top. Shiro should be thick, but if it is too thick for your liking, you can whisk in up to ½ cup more of hot water. Garnish, if you like, with sliced, fresh, green chili peppers.",10,7

4 cloves garlic, pressed through garlic press

1 teaspoon dried thyme
¼ cup sherry, or white wine
1 ½ tablespoons flour
2 ¼ cup beef stock
2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves","Begin by gathering and prepping all of your meatball ingredients according to the ingredient list above to have ready and organized for use. Place your breadcrumbs into a dish, and add the milk to them to soak for 5 minutes.
In the meantime, place your ground beef into a large bowl. After the breadcrumbs have soaked, add them to the ground beef, along with the parsley, thyme, herbes de Provence, salt, pepper, minced onion, garlic, ¼ cup of the shredded Gruyere cheese, and whisked egg.
Using your clean hands, gently mix the beef together with the ingredients until well-combined, but taking care not to over mix to keep the meatballs tender.
Scoop out 2 tablespoon-size portions of the meat mixture (I like to use my cookie scoop for this), and place onto a tray or large platter to hold.
Wet your hands with a bit of water, and roll each portion into a round meatball, then place the rolled meatballs into the fridge to chill for 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, gather and prep all of your French onion sauce ingredients according to the ingredient list above to have ready and organized for use.
Once the meatballs have chilled, place a large cast iron skillet (or other large, oven-safe, heavy bottom pan that can accommodate the meatballs and sauce) over medium-high heat, and add 2 tablespoons of the olive oil.
Once hot, add a batch of meatballs into the pan and allow them to sear and brown on all sides for about 8 to 10 minutes.
Place the meatballs onto a tray or sheet pan to hold while you brown the rest of the meatballs.
In the same skillet as you browned the meatballs (which should be on medium-high heat), add another 2 tablespoons of the oil (if there's already enough oil from browning the meatballs, skip the added oil), as well as the ghee or butter.
Once hot and melted, add the onions plus a pinch of salt and pepper, and allow them to cook down and deeply caramelize for about 20 to 25 minutes, stirring frequently, until the onions become very dark, soft and jammy.
Then, stir in the garlic, herbes de Provence and dried thyme, just until aromatic (about 30 seconds).
Add in the sherry or wine, and allow it to bubble up and reduce for about 30 seconds.
Sprinkle in the flour and stir that in to incorporate for about 30 seconds, then pour in the beef stock and whisk or vigorously stir to blend in and combine until smooth.
Allow the French onion sauce to simmer to 5 minutes, just to tighten it up.
Meanwhile, turn your broiler on “high”.
Turn the heat off under the sauce, and stir in the fresh thyme leaves.
Nestle back into the pan the browned meatballs, and top them with a combination of the Gruyere and mozzarella cheeses.
Place under the broiler for about 5 to 7 minutes, or until the cheese becomes nice and gooey and melted.
To serve, sprinkle over the meatballs some additional thyme leaves as garnish, and spoon 3 to 4 meatballs, along with lots of with sauce and cheese, into a bowl to enjoy with warm, toasted bread, or over hot mashed potatoes, if desired.",25,20

Wash thoroughly with cold water two to three times. These days, we’re never too cautious about making sure all of the dirt and pesticides are rinsed away. The best method is to use a large basin or sink to rinse and swirl around the vegetables letting them soak for a few minutes before draining and washing again. Shake off the excess water after the final rinse and transfer to a colander to drain. It is important to drain the vegetables well since these veggies will release quite a bit of water during the cooking process.

Gochujang-Glazed Eggplant With Fried Scallions,"Loosely inspired by the Korean banchan gaji bokkeum (stir-fried eggplant), this recipe keeps the eggplant in large pieces and sears it over high heat, yielding beautifully cooked flesh and still-violet skin. Though gaji bokkeum is traditionally soy sauce-based, my mother uses gochujang, the fermented Korean chile paste, for added sweetness and heat. The result is divine: As the sticky red sauce clings to the fried eggplant spears, it caramelizes in the heat of the pan and provides a glossy finish. The real star of this dish, though, is the scallion oil. The tangle of thinly sliced scallions crisps in olive oil, lending its oniony flavor to the oil, which is then used to cook the eggplant. This dish is salty, spicy and sweet — everything you want in a banchan — and tastes great with a bowl of fresh white rice.",6 servings,https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021441-gochujang-glazed-eggplant-with-fried-scallions,https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021441-gochujang-glazed-eggplant-with-fried-scallions?smid=ck-recipe-iOS-share,,,,https://vp.nyt.com/video/2023/01/10/105441_1_EK-Gochujang-eggplant-CV_wg_480p.mp4,"The information shown is Edamam’s estimate based on available ingredients and preparation.

Make the pepperoncini butter sauce:
Melt the butter (I just do this in the microwave). Stir in the garlic, brine, and pepperoncini pieces. Set aside.
Grill the chicken:
Using a grill, grill pan, or skillet, cook the chicken until cooked through and golden brown on both sides. If you have a meat thermometer, I highly recommend using it so you don’t overcook the chicken! We’re looking for 160 degrees. Let it rest for a moment, then cut into slices.
Assemble:
If you want to serve it as a family-style meal – layer the hummus on a large platter. Add the cucumber salad in 3-4 little mounds around the outside of the plate.

When you’re ready to cook the tofu, prepare your grill. Light one chimney full of charcoal. When all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and arrange coals on one side of the charcoal grate. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill, and allow to preheat for 5 minutes.
When your grill is hot, clean and oil the grilling grate.
Place tofu slices over the cooler side of the grill, away from the coals. Cover and cook for about 10 minutes. Carefully flip tofu and grill until browned and crisp, about 10 minutes more. Transfer to a large plate.
Using a spoon or brush, coat each piece of tofu on both sides with the reserved marinade mixture. Sprinkle scallions on top and serve right away.",8,8

Hoisin Garlic Noodles,"Fans of garlic noodles and soy sauce noodles rejoice: Here is a new, weeknight-friendly noodle dish for your repertoire. A staple Cantonese ingredient, thick and fragrant hoisin sauce is often used as a glaze for meat, but also serves as a robust, sweet and salty seasoning for these noodles. The garlic is bloomed briefly in oil, which tames its pungency and unlocks a rich, nutty flavor. Allow the noodles to cook undisturbed for a few minutes to crisp underneath, adding texture and a hint of smokiness. This recipe calls for dried wheat or egg noodles, but if you don’t have Asian-style noodles on hand, you could substitute with spaghetti or linguine. Bulk up the noodles with tofu, eggs or whatever vegetables you have on hand; these noodles welcome toppings.",4 servings,https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1026260-hoisin-garlic-noodles,https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1026260-hoisin-garlic-noodles?smid=ck-recipe-iOS-share,5.0,20.0,25.0,,"The information shown is Edamam’s estimate based on available ingredients and preparation.

Secondly, I added 1.5 tablespoons of Chinese black vinegar to balance the sweetness of the hoisin. I also added a 1/4 cup of shaoxing wine (you can substitute sherry) to add complexity. You could also add a 1/4 cup of chicken stock (or mushroom stock) if you want to have more sauce in the dish. Otherwise, an easy and enjoyable dish.Is this helpful? 1177MV5 months ago@Todd I made this recipe exactly to your specifications as I had both the aged black vinegar shaoxing cooking wine on hand. Used 14oz of pho tuoi rice sticks and pork sausage. Absolute perfection. We’ll keep this on rotation!Is this helpful? 432Anna5 months agoI let some water stay with the noodles, and then used the steam to help me know when to take the pan off the heat. When the pan stopped steaming, there was a perfect ratio of caramelized to soft noodles. Offered a variety of chopped herbs/proteins/condiments so each person could customize their portion. Kids and adults alike cleaned their plates.Is this helpful? 365Robert1 week agoMade exactly as written w/ two changes: my lo mein (egg noodles) package was only 10ozs, and I added ginger to the sauté the garlic/scallion whites part of the recipe. It was so freaking good. Not too sweet with the hoisin I used. Plenty of food for two, maybe three, though for three or four I’d prob use two 10oz packages and double the sauce. This was so easy and so good. Total keeper. Any protein would be a great addition.Is this helpful? 1DC2 weeks agoEnded up putting the full 16-oz package of pasta in and doubling the sauce. Also added a small amount of hoison into my bowl. With tofu or chicken, this is a simple and tasty dish. Fully agree that maple syrup or honey would be too much.Is this helpful?Tim3 weeks agoAdded fresh ginger to the garlic, plus taugé to the noodles and lime juice at the end.Is this helpful?Private

2 quarts water, 8 cups","Chop the chicken and vegetables. Chop 2 to 3 pounds chicken parts into 2 to 3-inch pieces and place in a large pot. Dice 1 medium carrot, 1 medium celery stalk, and 1/2 medium yellow onion, and add to the pot.
Add the parsley and water. Add 2 fresh parsley sprigs to the pot, then pour in 2 quarts water.
Bring to a simmer. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, making sure it does not come to a boil. You want a gentle, constant bubbling, mostly around the edges.
Simmer for 2 hours. Keep at a gentle simmer, reducing the heat if needed, and cook for 2 hours. You can skim off the scum that floats to the surface occasionally if you’d like, but it isn’t absolutely necessary. Check by tasting after 2 hours — if the stock isn’t as flavorful as you’d like, keep simmering and taste again every 15 minutes.
Strain the stock. When the stock is ready, fit a fine-mesh strainer (or colander lined with a coffee filter or double layer of cheesecloth) over a large heatproof bowl. Pour the stock through the strainer, then discard the contents of the strainer.
Skim the fat from the stock if desired. If you’d like to remove the fat from the stock, let it cool until the fat settles at the top, then skim it off with a spoon. You can also more easily remove the fat by chilling the stock and spooning the congealed fat from the surface later.
Use or store the stock. The stock is now ready to be used. To store, pour into storage containers (it’ll cool faster that way), and let cool uncovered at room temperature 1 hour. Cover and refrigerate up to 5 days or freeze up to 3 months.",6,7

 OMG! Yes please!! Will definitely be trying these! I do have a question about getting the dough to rise. I have the worst time with yeast and not getting a good rise. Any tips or tricks?

Reply",False,False,0,"Baked Goods, Breakfast, American","Baked Goods, Breakfast, American",231.0,10.7,6.3,30.1,9.9,0.9,4.0,217.5,49.7,"Cinnamon roll brioche dough:
½ cup lukewarm water, not hot water
1 teaspoon instant yeast
1 teaspoon kosher salt
½ cup butter, melted
2 eggs
3 tablespoons honey
2 ½ cups flour + extra for dusting
Cinnamon roll filling:
3 tablespoons butter, melted
5 tablespoons white sugar
5 tablespoons brown sugar
1 teaspoon cinnamon
Cream cheese frosting:
2 ounces cream cheese, softened
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
⅓ cup powdered sugar
2 tablespoons milk, more as needed
¼ teaspoon vanilla extract
small pinch of salt","Make the dough:
Start by adding the water and yeast to a bowl. Melt the butter, whisk in the honey, then the egg and salt. Add your butter mixture to the bowl, and then measure in the flour. Mix with a wooden spoon until combined. It will be messy, sticky, and loose – that is correct.
First rise:
Cover loosely with plastic wrap or a damp towel, and let her rest at room temperature for 1-2 hours until the dough ball has puffed up and roughly doubled in size. I often turn on my oven to 200 degrees and place the dough bowl in close proximity to the fan to speed this process up.
Store in the fridge:
Once the dough has doubled in size, gently reach in with your hand and pull the sticky dough from the edges of the bowl. This should somewhat deflate the dough – that’s great. Put the bowl in the fridge, covered with plastic wrap. It needs at least 3 hours in the fridge so the dough has time to chill and become easier to handle. Don’t try to work with it right after the first rise – chilling is necessary to make it workable. The dough can stay in the fridge for up to 5 days.
Assemble the rolls:
Remove the dough from the fridge and coat the outside lightly with flour. Roll your dough ball out to about a 9x13 rectangle. This dough doesn’t like to be over-handled, and you don’t want to have to add a lot of extra flour – so work with it right out of the fridge.
Filling:
Brush the rectangle with the melted butter and sprinkle with the sugars and cinnamon. You can use your hands to press it in and make sure it’s all evenly coated.
Roll:
Roll the dough up starting at the short side. Try not to over-handle the dough as it will become sticky. Once the log is rolled up, use floss or a very sharp knife to trim the uneven ends, and then cut the log into 8 equal rolls. Place the rolls in a 9-10 inch round baking dish or pie plate (another size could also work, I just like how they fit in a round pan with 7 around the outside and one in the center).
Second rise:
Preheat the oven to 200 degrees and then turn it off. Cover the pan loosely with plastic wrap or a damp towel and let the rolls rest in the turned-off oven for 45 minutes. They should fit a little more snugly together in the pan at this point. Cute! Take them out and turn the oven back on to 350 degrees. Bake at 350 degrees for 20-22 minutes.
Prep the cream cheese frosting:
Use an electric mixer to beat the cream cheese and butter until smooth and creamy. Mix in the powdered sugar, vanilla, and a little bit of milk at a time until you get a smooth glaze; then continue to beat with the electric mixer until you have a light and fluffy frosting.
Frost and enjoy:
When they come out of the oven, give them a minute to cool. Then brush or spoon them with the frosting so it gets every crevice coated with gooey, drippy deliciousness. You can frost them again (second layer!) once they’ve cooled a bit more. Savor every warm, pillowy, glazed bite. YOU MADE THAT. Cinnamon roll bliss is yours!",17,18
How to Grill Brisket,A basic method for how to grill brisket on a gas grill.,6 servings,https://www.foodtasticmom.com/how-to-grill-brisket/,https://www.foodtasticmom.com/how-to-grill-brisket/,60.0,240.0,300.0,,,False,False,0,,,,,,,,,,,,"1 3 - pound brisket
1 tbsp sugar
2 tsp salt
1 tsp sweet paprika
½ tsp onion powder
½ tsp black pepper
¼ tsp cayenne pepper
2 grill safe foil pans
2 cups hickory wood chips","Whisk together the sugar, salt, paprika, onion powder, black pepper and cayenne pepper. Rub the outside of the brisket evenly with the rub. Allow the rubbed brisket to sit on a cutting board on the counter for 30 minutes.
Pour the wood chips in one of the foil pans and add enough water to just cover the chips. Cover with foil and cut slits in the foil to allow smoke to escape.
Light your grill and scrape the grates clean.
Turn the burners on one half of the grill off. Keep the burners on the other half set to LOW heat.
Place the brisket directly on the lit side of the grill, fatty side up and grill for about 5 minutes. Turn the brisket over and grill for 5 minutes more.
Place the brisket into the remaining, clean foil pan (fat side up) and move it to the unlit side of the grill. Place the covered foil pan with the wood chips in it on the lit side of the grill and close the grill.
Allow the brisket to cook for approximately three hours. You want your grill temperature to remain at about 300 degrees which can be achieved by adjusting the grill vents. With my gas grill keeping one side lit on low and one side off, plus opening the vents, kept it at this temperature.
In about the final 30 minutes of grilling time, turn the brisket over so the fat side is down next to the foil and baste the non-fatty side of the brisket with your favorite barbecue sauce. I have linked to my favorite barbecue sauce in this post if you would like the recipe for Apple Butter Barbecue Sauce.
Remove the brisket from the grill and baste again. Allow to rest on a cutting board for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.",9,9

Coat the bottom of a non-stick saute pan or saucepan with olive oil. Fry the eggplant slices over medium-high heat until the underside is golden-brown. Flip the eggplant slices and continue cooking them until golden-brown on both sides. The eggplant should be very tender and a fork pierced through the center should go cleanly through. Remove to a plate and set aside.
In the same pan, place the sliced tomatoes in a single layer. Roast a minute on each side. Set aside.
Add another tablespoon of olive oil to the pan. Add onions with a generous pinch of salt and saute over medium heat until the onions begin to brown.

12 ounces beef flank steak, cut into small 1/4-inch or 0.6cm thick pieces
2 teaspoons cornstarch
2 teaspoons Shaoxing wine
2 teaspoons oil, any neutral oil with a high smoke point, such as canola or avocado oil
2 teaspoons oyster sauce
0.1 teaspoon baking soda
For the sauce:
3 tablespoons warm water, or beef/chicken stock
1 tablespoon light soy sauce
1 tablespoon rice vinegar
1 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon cornstarch
1 teaspoon hoisin sauce
0.5 teaspoon Sichuan peppercorn powder
0.5 teaspoon dark soy sauce
0.5 teaspoon sesame oil
To roast the peanuts (or substitute unsalted roast:
1 tablespoon oil, any neutral oil with a high smoke point
1 cup raw peanuts, shelled and skinned
For the rest of the dish:
2 tablespoons oil, any neutral oil with a high smoke point
1 teaspoon fresh ginger, minced
5 dried red chilies, deseeded and sliced into small pieces; these can be spicy, so adjust according to your own taste
0.5 cup bell pepper, diced; preferably red, orange, or yellow bell pepper
2 scallions, chopped, white and green parts separated
2 cloves garlic, chopped","In a medium bowl, combine the beef, cornstarch, Shaoxing wine, oil, oyster sauce, and baking soda until the beef is evenly coated. Marinate for 1 hour at room temperature.
Prepare the sauce by combining the warm water or stock, light soy sauce, rice vinegar, sugar, cornstarch, hoisin sauce, Sichuan peppercorn powder, dark soy sauce, and sesame oil. Set aside.
Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a wok over medium heat, and add the peanuts. Stir constantly (or they’ll burn) for 5 minutes, until golden brown and fragrant. Turn off the heat and stir for another minute using the residual heat in the wok. Set aside to cool. They will turn crunchy once they’re cooled completely. You can also skip this step and use already roasted shelled peanuts.
Add 2 more tablespoons of oil to the wok. Heat the wok over high heat until it’s just smoking. Sear the beef for 1½ minutes on each side, or until the beef is slightly crispy on both sides. Having a hot wok is really important to avoid overcooking the beef. Reduce the heat to low, and remove the beef from the wok, leaving behind any oil.
Over low heat, add the ginger and chilies. Toast until fragrant, taking care not to burn them. Add the bell peppers and white portions of the scallion. Cook for 1-2 minutes, until fragrant. Add the garlic, and stir-fry for 20 seconds.
Add the beef and its juices back to the wok, and increase the heat to high. Stir-fry for 30 seconds.
Stir up your prepared sauce (the cornstarch will have settled to the bottom, so make sure it’s well-incorporated). Add the sauce to the wok and stir everything together to deglaze it.
Once the sauce is thickened and simmering, add the peanuts and the green parts of the scallions. There should be no standing sauce, but if it looks a little too thick, you can add a splash of water or stock. Give everything a final stir, turn off the heat, and serve with jasmine rice!",23,8
Kung Pao Tofu,"Fiery from dried chiles, tingling with Sichuan peppercorns and studded with peanuts, this kung pao tofu recipe is a vegetarian take on kung pao chicken, the classic Chinese American restaurant staple. Though variations on this dish abound, this version swaps in tofu for chicken, treating the tofu similarly. Pressing the tofu removes excess moisture, leaving more room for flavor to penetrate and giving it a denser, chewy texture. The cornstarch coating helps the tofu brown, makes it crisp and acts as a sponge for the savory, spicy, tingly sauce.",4 servings,https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1025397-kung-pao-tofu,https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1025397-kung-pao-tofu?algo=combo_cooking_rec4u_bert_unique_60_specialdiets_20_top_conv_save_decay_30day_0.8_click&campaign_id=333&emc=edit_ckfy_20251018&fellback=false&imp_id=4514307262775506&instance_id=164707&nl=your-recipe-recommendations&pool=cooking-rec4u-ls&regi_id=100587641&req_id=7655789752246462&segment_id=208180&surface=cooking-email-rec4u&user_id=7cde6293cffa46b798d7160c14dc5491&variant=0_bert_unique_save_decay_30day_0.8_click,30.0,30.0,60.0,,"The information shown is Edamam’s estimate based on available ingredients and preparation.

I coated the cubes in potato starch, used spray oil and baked them separately at 425 for about 20 minutes. They crisped up nicely and no soggy oil mess. Folded them into the wok at end of stir fry. Perfect!Is this helpful? 716Maria from CA1 year agoVegetarian family favorite that pleased everyone. Mom tip: Baking the tofu (400 for 25 minutes) means you can be at the stove for 7 minutes less and still have some bite in the tofu. And if you have teens: double the recipe. 14 oz of tofu is enough for about 2 teens. I didn't have the chilis so used chili crunch - worked great.Is this helpful? 431Mare1 year agoMy hoisen was really sweet so I eliminated the sugar but made as written otherwise.

It is awesome. If you can find it, super firm tofu eliminates the need to press. Saves time and it really does have the ""toothsomeness"" that this dish needs with the tofu. Good ginger and good garlic (thank-you Saugerties Garlic Festival) make a big difference with flavor. You'll spend more time prepping than actually cooking too.Is this helpful? 1Private comments are only visible to you.Show more commentsRecipe TagsChineseBudgetCast IronChiles De ArbolChinese

Shallot:
2 medium shallots, thinly sliced
3 Tbsp brown rice flour
⅛ tsp each sea salt and black pepper
1 ~2 Tbsp olive oil or avocado oil, for cooking — if avoiding oil, omit and use a non-stick pan
Salad:
¼ cup Macadamia Nut Cheese, or sub store-bought soft vegan cheese
6 cups arugula, or other green of choice
3 Tbsp Cashew Parmesan Cheese, optional
Dressing:
1 Lemon Vinaigrette","To roast the garlic, peel apart garlic cloves but leave the skin on. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C). Add garlic cloves to a baking sheet. Drizzle garlic with a bit of olive oil. Bake for about 20 minutes or until the garlic is fragrant and slightly browned. Remove from oven and set aside.
In the meantime, add sliced shallots to a small bowl with brown rice flour, salt, and pepper, and toss to coat. Heat a medium (preferably cast iron) skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add oil and floured shallots and sauté, stirring occasionally, until lightly golden brown and crispy — approximately 5 minutes. Set aside in pan.
In the meantime, if not using store-bought soft vegan ""cheese,"" make your own. Add macadamia nuts to a food processor or a high-speed blender along with lemon juice, nutritional yeast, garlic powder, sea salt, and lesser amount of water (1/4 cup or 60 ml as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Mix/blend, scraping down sides as needed. Then add more water 1 Tbsp (15 ml) at a time until a thick paste forms. I find I get the best texture results with a food processor, but in a pinch, a blender can work too. It just generally requires more scraping and more liquid.
Next, prepare dressing by adding all ingredients to a mixing bowl (or small blender) and whisking (or blending) to combine. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more maple syrup for sweetness, lemon for acidity, or salt or pepper to taste. Set aside.
Assemble salad by adding greens to a serving bowl or platter and topping with roasted garlic cloves (skins removed), crispy shallots, macadamia nut cheese, and cashew parmesan cheese (optional).
Add dressing to the salad and toss to coat, or serve on the side. Best when fresh. Store salad separate from dressing if keeping for later use. Will keep in the refrigerator up to 2-3 days. Store dressing in the refrigerator 3-4 days. The oil can harden when cold, so let dressing set out for a few minutes to warm and shake well to reincorporate before serving leftovers.",10,6

4 tablespoons vegetable oil, 3-4, divided
5 shiitake mushrooms, fresh or dried/reconstituted; thinly sliced
8 ounces Chinese chives, 225g, cut into 2-inch long pieces, with the light and dark green parts separated","Boil 3 quarts of water in a large wok or pot to pre-cook your Yi Mein noodles. Once boiling, add the noodles. The directions on the box may say to boil the noodles for 5 minutes, but we recommend no more than 3 to 4 minutes to keep them firm and chewy. Overcook them, and you will end up with a mushy texture.
Sample a noodle while cooking, and when it tastes closer to the uncooked side of al dente pasta, it’s ready. When the noodles are done, immediately drain and set aside.
Dissolve the sugar and salt in 1 tablespoon of hot water, and add the regular soy sauce, dark soy sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil, and white pepper. Stir until combined.
Heat the wok until just smoking, and spread 2 tablespoons of oil around the perimeter.
Add the mushrooms and the light green parts of the chives, and stir fry for 30 seconds. The mushrooms are like sponges and will soak up the oil, so add another tablespoon of oil if they look too dry.
Add the noodles (they still should be warm but with no water dripping), and stir fry everything for another 20 seconds. If they cooled off, just cook them a bit longer until they are warmed, because warming the noodles before adding the sauce is important!
Spread the prepared sauce mixture evenly over the noodles, and stir-fry everything together for 1 minute, or until the soy sauce mixture is distributed evenly. Spread another tablespoon of oil around the perimeter of the wok to prevent sticking if you feel you need it. How much oil you use is definitely a personal preference. If the noodles stick together, drizzle a bit of oil directly over the noodles. You can also add a splash of hot water if the noodles are too dry, even after adding the sauce.
Mix gently so you don’t break up the noodles–remember, you want to have long noodles to give longevity and prosperity to whoever’s going to be eating this dish!
Add in the remaining green parts of the chives and mix until they turn bright green and the noodles are heated through. This will take 1-3 minutes, depending on if your noodles were cold or still warm when you started stir frying, and how hot your stove and wok can get.",13,9

2 teaspoons neutral oil, such as vegetable, canola, or avocado oil
2 teaspoons Shaoxing wine, or dry cooking sherry, optional
1 teaspoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon cornstarch

For coating and searing the beef:
0.5 cup cornstarch
0.66 cup neutral oil
For the rest of the dish:
1 teaspoon ginger, minced
8 dried red chili peppers, optional
3 cloves garlic, finely chopped

In a small bowl, mix the sauce. Dissolve the brown sugar in the hot water or stock, then stir in the light and dark soy sauces.
Next, dredge the marinated beef slices in the cornstarch until thoroughly coated.
Heat 2/3 cup neutral oil in a wok over high heat. Just before the oil starts to smoke, spread the flank steak pieces evenly in the wok, and sear for 1 minute on each side, until you have a crispy coating. Turn off the heat and transfer the beef to a plate.
Drain the oil from the wok (save it for other cooking), leaving 1 tablespoon behind. Turn the heat to medium-high. Add the ginger and dried chili peppers, if using. If you want the dish spicier, break 1-2 chilies in half.
After about 15 seconds, add the garlic and white parts of the scallions. Stir for another 15 seconds and add the premixed sauce.
Let the sauce simmer for about 2 minutes, and slowly stir in the cornstarch slurry mixture. Cook until the sauce has thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon.
Add the beef and green parts of the scallions, and toss everything together for another 30 seconds. The scallions should just be wilted, and there should be almost no liquid, as the sauce should be clinging to the beef. If you still have sauce, increase the heat slightly and stir until thickened.

Moroccan Lentil Soup (Harira),"The vegan Moroccan lentil soup, Harira, is headily aromatic with the warmth of ginger, turmeric, cinnamon and a dollop of homemade harissa paste. Chickpeas, pasta and spinach stir in a generous helping of flavor and nutrition. The food of the Mediterranean can morph across its different countries and regions in the most interesting ways. A Moroccan harira soup, for instance, is not unlike an Italian pasta e ceci. Both feature legumes and pasta in a brothy dish. Both are delicious and nourishing additions to the diet, especially this time of year. But they taste so very different because they are seasoned so differently. A harira contains a few spices - most already in your pantry - that give it so much warmth and character. It also has oodles of nutrients, from lentils, chickpeas (sometimes fava beans), pasta and greens. Some versions have small amounts of meat although our version here, being vegan, has none. This is not a creamy soup but it is silky, with a broth base and lots of texture from the chickpeas, lentils and pasta. Cilantro and parsley add a note of freshness to steady the warm spices. It's the perfect dinner, with everything you need in a single pot.",6 servings,https://holycowvegan.net/harira-recipe/,https://holycowvegan.net/harira-recipe/,15.0,35.0,50.0,,"Can I skip the harissa paste?

Can I use other greens in this recipe?
You can use any quick-cooking green, including Swiss chard, arugula, beet greens or watercress.
Why did the soup get so thick upon standing?
The beans and the pasta or rice will continue to thicken the soup long after cooking is over. If the harira has thickened too much, just add some water and reheat.

My Mom Swears By This Brilliant Trick for THE Best Steak (It’s Life-Changing!),"When Vietnamese people hear “sweetened condensed milk,” images of Vietnamese coffee, flan, shaved ice, and smashed avocado come to mind. When I was growing up, I saw my mom scrape the remnants from a can of sweetened condensed milk and add it to her meat marinade. At the time I thought it was her frugal nature — a byproduct of living through the Vietnam war and post-war era when food was scarce. She only had three ingredients in her pantry to use as a sweetener: granulated sugar, palm sugar, and sweetened condensed milk. She didn’t have anything “fancy” like honey, maple syrup, or molasses. It wasn’t until I was in college and started cooking that I came to understand the food science behind why using sweetened condensed milk is a great hack for caramelizing meat. Through the Maillard reaction — in which both protein and sugar interact when exposed to heat — the meat develops a beautiful, caramelized crust with a complex flavor.",1 pound of protein,https://www.thekitchn.com/sweetened-condensed-milk-marinade-23724859,https://www.thekitchn.com/sweetened-condensed-milk-marinade-23724859?utm_medium=k_daily&user_email=22fb79b51a3309e068583ab5a5900aae96eec1af263d3af1db9ba3fc0eeaaebc&lctg=66595f61df17fc86c2034831&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_campaign=K%20Daily%20Wed%20%28Reg%29%20%5BFinal%5D&utm_term=Reg%20Final%20Send%20514,,,,,,False,False,0,,,,,,,,,,,,"0.25 cup of Maggi seasoning

Cover with plastic wrap or a lid and leave in the fridge for at least 2 hours or up to overnight.

½ cup grated Parmesan cheese, 0.25-0.5","Preheat:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees and place a rack at the highest position, near the top.
Prep cottage cheese:
Blend the cottage cheese until smooth.
Make dough for crust:
Place blended cottage cheese in a bowl; mix with the flour, baking powder and salt until a dough starts to come together. It will start to get kind of shaggy, crumbly, and sticky – use your hands to really bring it together. I usually turn it out on the counter and give it a few squishes, coating with a bit of extra flour, to make it into a cohesive ball.
Form the crust:
Place a sheet of parchment on a pizza pan or baking sheet. Place the dough on the parchment and press into a circle that is about 10-12 inches in diameter. It is a pretty bready crust, so you want to really press it out into a thinner, wider surface area.
Prep the crust:
Rub the top of the crust with olive oil.
Pre-Bake The Crust: Place in the oven; bake (no toppings) for 8-10 minutes.
Add sauce and cheese:
Remove from oven. Spread with sauce and top with the two cheeses. Bake on that same top rack for another 5 minutes to melt the cheeses.
Broil and finish:
Finally, broil for 2-3 minutes until the cheese and crust edges are deeply golden, like the picture. I like to sprinkle the slices with red pepper flakes, drizzle with olive oil or hot honey, and dip into more sauce! It’s too good!",8,15

Preheat a large, heavy bottom pot over medium-low heat. The wider the pot the better, so that you have lots of surface area to make your roux.
Add the oil and sprinkle in the flour. Use a wooden spatula to toss the flour in the oil, and stir pretty consistently for 3 to 4 minutes, until the flour is clumpy and toasty.
Add the onion and salt, and toss to coat the onions completely in the flour mixture. As the onions release moisture, they will coat more and more. Cook this way for 5 minutes, stirring often. Add garlic and stir for 30 seconds or so.
Add the peppers and tomatoes and cook down for about 10 more minutes. If using cherry tomatoes, place a cover on the pot to get them to cook faster and release moisture. As the tomatoes break down, the mixture should become thick and pasty.
Season with fresh black pepper, add bay leaves, smoked paprika and thyme and mix well.
Stream in the 2 1/2 cups vegetable broth, stirring constantly to prevent clumping. Add the okra and beans, then turn the heat up and cover to bring to a boil. Stir occasionally.
Once boiling, reduce the heat to a simmer and let cook uncovered for 30 to 45 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the stew is nicely thickened and the okra is tender. If it’s too thick, thin with up to 1/2 cup vegetable broth. If it’s not as thick as you like, just cook it a bit longer.

Pasta Puttanesca,"There are almost as many explanations for the origins of pasta puttanesca as there are ways to make it. Ostensibly a sauce invented and made by prostitutes, it was designed to lure customers with its powerful aroma. Whatever the origin, no better cold-weather pasta sauce has come down to us. Puttanesca can be made completely with ingredients from the larder; in fact, it can be prepared entirely without ingredients that require refrigeration, though a bit of a fresh herb at the end does help. The basis is a garlicky tomato sauce; canned tomatoes are preferable here. This is brought to a high level of flavor by the addition of anchovies, capers and olives. Red pepper flakes make things even better. The whole process is ridiculously easy.",6 servings,https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/11583-pasta-puttanesca,https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/11583-pasta-puttanesca?algo=combo_cooking_rec4u_bert_unique_60_specialdiets_20_top_conv_save_decay_30day_0.8_click&campaign_id=333&emc=edit_ckfy_20251018&fellback=false&imp_id=7312805519141024&instance_id=164708&nl=your-recipe-recommendations&pool=cooking-rec4u-ls&regi_id=100587641&req_id=5440150318801325&segment_id=208181&surface=cooking-email-rec4u&user_id=7cde6293cffa46b798d7160c14dc5491&variant=0_bert_unique_save_decay_30day_0.8_click,,,,,"The information shown is Edamam’s estimate based on available ingredients and preparation.

2 sticks unsalted butter, 1 cup
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons kosher salt
½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 cup grated Kefalotiri or Pecorino Romano cheese
¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg, optional
For the pasta:
1 ½ pounds dried ziti pasta or pastitsio noodles
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, 1/2 stick
¾ cup grated Kefalotiri or Pecorino Romano cheese","Let 2 quarts whole milk and 4 large eggs come to room temperature before making the sauce. Grate until you have 1 3/4 cups Kefalotiri or Pecorino Romano cheese.
Make the meat sauce:
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add 2 pounds ground meat. Cook, breaking the meat into smaller pieces with a wooden spoon, until cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes. If there is a lot of fat in the pan at this point, drain it off.
Add 2 tablespoons tomato paste to the pan and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly darkened in color. Add 1 can tomato sauce, 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper. If desired, add 2 whole garlic cloves, 1 bay leaf, and 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon. Bring to a boil.
Cover and simmer over medium-low heat until there's very little liquid left, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil over medium-high heat. Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to 375°F. Make the béchamel sauce.
Make the béchamel:
Melt 2 sticks unsalted butter in a medium pot over medium-low heat. Add 1 cup all-purpose flour and whisk until smooth. Continue to cook, whisking constantly, until starting to darken in color a little bit and the raw flour taste is cooked out, about 3 minutes.
Add the milk 1/2 cup at a time, whisking with each addition. It will be extremely thick at first, but will thin out. Increase the heat to medium-high and continue whisking. Cook, whisking often, until the mixture starts to bubble and thicken up, about 5 minutes. This happens very suddenly, so make sure your full attention is on the béchamel. Once it's thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, remove from the heat.
Season with 2 teaspoons kosher salt, 1 teaspoon black pepper, and 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg if desired. Add 1 cup of the cheese and whisk to combine. Add the eggs one at a time, whisking very quickly with each addition to prevent curdling, until combined.
Cook the pasta:
Add 1 1/2 pounds dried ziti or pastitsio noodles to the boiling water and cook 2 to 3 minutes more than package directions — you actually want to overcook your pasta a little bit. Meanwhile, cut 4 tablespoons unsalted butter into small pieces.
Drain the pasta and place in a large bowl. Add the butter, 3 cups of the béchamel, and the remaining 3/4 cup cheese. Toss until the butter is melted and everything is well coated.
Build and bake the pastitsio:
Spread 1/4 cup of the béchamel in a 9x13-inch baking dish. If using ziti, arrange 2/3 of the ziti piece by piece in the baking dish in 2 tight, even layers. If using pastitio noodles, just arrange into an even layer. Remove the garlic cloves from the meat sauce, then spread the meat sauce evenly over the pasta. Arrange the remaining pasta evenly over the meat sauce. Pour the remaining béchamel over the pasta until the pasta is completely covered, you may not need it all.
Bake until light golden brown, about 45 minutes. If it’s browning too much after 30 minutes, tent loosely with aluminum foil and continue baking. Let cool 45 minutes so the pastitsio has time to set up so that you can cut clean slices. Serve warm. Once sliced, reheat if desired, serve, and enjoy!",20,15

In a medium heatproof mixing bowl set on top of a dampened towel (this serves as a stable base), stir together sugar, cornstarch, and salt. Whisk in egg yolks until mixture is pale yellow, smooth, and fluffy, about 1 minute.
Uncover infused milk and remove vanilla bean (see note). While whisking continuously, slowly pour milk into egg yolk mixture in a thin stream, until all of it has been added.
Return the mixture to the same saucier. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly until pastry cream begins to thicken, about 5 minutes. Once it thickens, continue to whisk, pausing every few seconds to check for bubbles, about 1 minute. When it begins to bubble, set a timer and continue whisking for 1 minute. This step is important to neutralize a starch-dissolving protein found in egg yolks.
Off-heat, whisk in butter until melted and thoroughly combined. Strain pastry cream through a fine-mesh sieve set over a heatproof medium bowl. Immediately place plastic wrap or buttered parchment paper directly on the surface of the cream to prevent a skin from forming.

Pelmeni filling:
In a large bowl, mix the ground meat, grated onion, salt, and pepper with your hands until well-combined.
Assemble the pelmeni (mold or by hand):
To save time, use a pelmeni mold to shape the dumplings. To do so, roll out a flat piece of dough and place it on the well-floured mold. Fill each hole with meat.
Make another flat, round piece of dough and place it on top. Sprinkle with flour and use a rolling pin to roll over the dough until each dumpling is separated.
Flip the mold over and shake out the pelmeni. Dust them with flour. At this point, you can either freeze them for later or boil them to eat immediately.
Alternatively, you can make the pelmeni by hand. To do so, roll the dough out and cut small circles out of it using a cookie cutter. Place the meat mixture in the middle and fold over the sides into a half-moon shape, pinching the edges together to secure the filling inside. Connect the two corners together. Repeat until you have no dough or meat mixture left.
Boil the pelmeni:
Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Add the pelmeni in. Once they float to the top, they are finished and ready to be taken out. Strain the pelmeni with a colander. Drizzle them with butter and serve with a side of sour cream. Enjoy!",10,12

2 cloves garlic, finely grated or minced
¼ cup water
1 ½ teaspoons spicy brown or whole grain mustard
¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more as needed
1 large egg, lightly beaten, if baking
2 cups neutral oil, if frying","Make the dough:
Whisk 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon baking powder, and 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt together in a large bowl. Create a deep well in the center. Whisk 1 large egg, 1/2 cup melted unsalted butter, 1/2 cup warm water, and 1 teaspoon distilled white vinegar together in a medium bowl. Pour into the well.
Using a fork and starting in the center, gradually stir and pull in the flour mixture until a shaggy dough forms. Knead the dough a few times until it forms a smooth, soft ball. Wrap the dough tightly in plastic wrap and let rest for 1 hour to firm up. Meanwhile, make the filling.
Make the filling and roll out the dough:
Place 1 1/2 pounds peeled and cut Yukon gold potatoes and 2 tablespoons of the kosher salt in a medium saucepan and add enough cold water to cover by about 1 inch. Cover and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Uncover and reduce the heat to maintain a simmer. Cook until knife tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain in a colander.
Melt 2 tablespoons unsalted butter in the same saucepan (no need to wash) over medium-high heat. Add 1 finely diced large yellow onion and 2 grated garlic cloves. Cook, stirring frequently, until the onions are translucent and lightly browned in spots, about 8 minutes.
Add 1/4 cup water, scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the saucepan, and cook until the water is almost completely evaporated, about 45 seconds. Remove the saucepan from the heat.
Return the potatoes to the saucepan. Add 1 teaspoon spicy brown mustard and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Mix and mash with a fork or potato masher until the potatoes are broken down but still lumpy. Taste and season with more kosher salt and pepper as needed.
Divide the dough in half (about 11 ounces each). Working with one piece at a time, roll out into an 8- by 16-inch rectangle (about 1/8-inch thick). Proceed with either baking or frying instructions.
Option 1: baking:
Heat the oven to 375ºF. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Spread half of the potato filling (about 1 1/2 cups) onto one of the dough rectangles in a log along one of the long sides. Starting with the end with the filling, roll up into a log. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling.
Cut each log crosswise into 4 pieces. Pinch the dough along one cut side of each piece together to cover and seal in the filling on that side. Place sealed-side down on the baking sheet, spacing them evenly apart. Using the palm of your hand, gently press down until each knish is about 1 1/2 inches tall.
Lightly brush the dough of each knish with 1 beaten large egg. Bake until golden brown, about 45 minutes.
Option 2: frying:
Cut each dough rectangle in half crosswise and lengthwise to get a total of 8 pieces. Divide the filling between the dough pieces (about 1/3 cup each). For each knish, fold the dough over the filling to form a square. Press the edges with your fingers or the tines of a fork to seal (make sure to press out any air). Trim the edges with a knife (save the scraps to test the temperature of the oil!).
Heat 2 cups neutral oil in a medium cast iron skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering (300 to 350ºF). Meanwhile, fit a wire rack over a baking sheet.
Test the oil with a small piece of scrap dough:
If it immediately starts bubbling, proceed with frying (if it doesn’t, the oil is not hot enough).

1 teaspoon baking powder
1 ½ tablespoons kosher salt
1 teaspoon finely ground white pepper
Chopped fresh parsley and chives, for garnish","Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 375°F.
Using the shredding disk of the food processor, shred 3 peeled and quartered yellow onions and 4 pounds peeled and quartered russet potatoes. You will likely have to do this in 4 batches, simply transfer each batch of shredded onion and potato to a large bowl while you continue shredding.
Lay 1/4 of the grated onion and potato on a large triple layer of cheesecloth or clean, lint-free kitchen towel. Gather the corners and tie around the handle of a wooden spoon. Dangle the bundle over a medium bowl, then twist and squeeze the onion and potatoes as hard as you can until no more liquid comes out. Do not discard the liquid. Transfer the onion and potatoes to a clean, large bowl. Repeat this squeezing process with the rest of the grated onion and potato, replacing the cheesecloth if it tears.
Give the liquid a few minutes to allow the potato starch to settle, and then pour off and discard the liquid but leave the potato starch; set aside.
Place 4 large eggs and 4 large egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. (Alternatively, use an electric hand mixer and large bowl.) Beat on medium-high speed until lightened in color and doubled in volume, 3 to 4 minutes.
Add the reserved potato starch, 1/4 cup of the schmaltz or oil, 1 teaspoon baking powder, 1 1/2 tablespoons kosher salt, and 1 teaspoon finely ground white pepper. Beat on medium speed until combined. Add the reserved onion and potato and use your fingers to toss them with the egg mixture until evenly coated.
Brush a 9x13-inch baking dish with the remaining 2 tablespoons of schmaltz or oil. Heat in the oven for 5 minutes.
Carefully transfer the mixture to the preheated baking dish and spread into an even layer but do not press down on it. Bake until golden-brown and an instant read thermometer registers at least 160°F, 40 to 50 minutes.
Turn the broiler to high. Broil the kugel until the top is richly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Cut into generous slices and serve immediately with a sprinkle of parsley or chives.",9,9

To make the filling:
Place shrimp in a food processor, and process until shrimp are finely ground; transfer into a large bowl and set aside. Working in batches, process ground beef until fine, add to ground shrimp. Add ginger, shallot, green onions, napa cabbage, soy sauce, sesame oil, salt, white pepper, and white sugar to shrimp and beef mixture; mix thoroughly until well combined.
To fill the potstickers:
Place a wrapper on the work surface and add a scant teaspoon of filling in the center. With a wet finger, dampen the edges of the wrapper. Fold dough into a half-moon shape, enclosing the filling, and press and seal to remove extra air and tightly seal the edges together. It's nice to fold several small pleats in the top half of the wrapper for a traditional look before you seal in the filling. Refrigerate the filled wrappers on a parchment-lined baking sheet while you finish filling and sealing the potstickers.
Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet with a lid over medium heat. Place potstickers into hot oil, flat-side down, without crowding, and let fry until the bottoms are golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Turn dumplings over, and pour water over them. Cover the pan with a lid and let dumplings steam until water has nearly evaporated and dumplings have begun to fry in oil again, 5 to 7 minutes. Uncover the skillet, and let potstickers cook until all the water is evaporated and the wrapper has shrunk down tightly onto the filling, another 2 to 3 minutes.",13,19

1. American “Chili Powder” is not pure ground chilli, it contains other spices like paprika and is not very spicy. This recipe calls for pure ground chilli for spiciness, or cayenne pepper.
2. Garam Masala – Spice mix used in Indian cooking, a more legit curry powder. Sold at regular grocery stores in Australia -> Coles, Woolworths, Harris Farms.
3. Roti – Flaky Indian round flatbread that’s sold in the freezer section of large grocery stores these days. Love them because they’re so handy – cook from frozen on the stove in just a couple of minutes. Cheap, tasty, if you’ve never tried it, it’s a game changer! 🙂
4. Mint yogurt – Blitzing makes yogurt watery. So just blitz the minimum to puree the mint, then stir the rest in which thickens the sauce up again.

2 cups smoked tricolor quinoa, 340 g, instructions for smoked grains follow below
1 Kosher salt
2 bunches young carrots, with greens, preferably a mix of colors
1 Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling
1 Freshly ground black pepper
3 green onions
1 Meyer lemon, Finely grated zest and juice
Handful of arugula or 1/3 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, 15 g","Prepare a charcoal grill for two-zone cooking and build a medium fire, or heat a gas grill to medium-high. When the coals are glowing red and covered with a fine gray ash, add your smoke source (chips, chunks, or log). Carefully wipe the preheated grill grates with a lightly oiled paper towel. Using a grill brush, scrape the grill grates clean, then carefully wipe with a lightly oiled towel again. If you’re using a grill basket, allow it to preheat for 5 minutes before cooking.
While the grill heats, cook the quinoa on the stovetop. Bring the water to a boil in a saucepan over medium-high heat and add the quinoa and a pinch of salt. Turn the heat to low, cover the pan, and simmer for 15 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and let the quinoa sit, covered, for 10 minutes, until the grains are tender and have absorbed all the liquid, then uncover the pan and let the quinoa cool briefly.
Meanwhile, trim the carrots, leaving a small portion of the green stem intact and reserving the nicest fronds. Place the carrots in a large bowl, drizzle with enough olive oil to coat, season generously with salt and pepper, and toss to combine. Remove the fronds from the stems, rinse and dry and then coarsely chop until you have about 1 ⁄4 cup (10 g); set aside.
When the fire begins to produce a steady stream of smoke, place the carrots and green onions in the grill basket over direct heat and cover the grill. Open the lid every minute or so to turn the carrots and onions and rotate the pan around the heat as needed to prevent burning, until the vegetables are nicely charred and just tender, about 5 minutes for the green onions and 20 minutes for the carrots. Use tongs to transfer the vegetables as they finish cooking to a cutting board to cool.
Slice the carrots as desired and add them to a large bowl with the quinoa, Meyer lemon zest and juice, and a generous drizzle of olive oil. Trim the stems from the green onions, chop, and add to the quinoa with the arugula and carrot fronds. Toss to combine. Season with salt and pepper to taste, and serve warm or at room temperature.
For the smoked grains:
Prepare a charcoal grill for two-zone cooking and build a medium-high fire, or heat a gas grill to high.
When the coals are glowing red and covered with a fine gray ash, remove the cooking grate and place a drip pan with 1 inch (2.5 cm) of warm water on the side with no coals, and add your smoke source (chips, chunks, or log). Return the cooking grate to its position, allow it to preheat, and then carefully wipe the grates with a lightly oiled paper towel. Using a grill brush, scrape the grill grates clean, then carefully wipe with a lightly oiled towel again.
Place the grains in a disposable aluminum pan or atop two sheets of heavy-duty aluminum foil (crimp the edges of foil upward to create a rim and prevent the grains from sliding off).
When the fire begins to produce a steady stream of smoke, place the grains over indirect heat, close the grill, vent the grill for smoking, and smoke for 15 to 30 minutes (depending on their size, density, and the heat), until they’ve darkened a few shades, typically from the perimeter of the pan inward (which is why you want to stir them a time or two for even results). The smoking time is a general guide and assumes an internal temperature of around 300°F (150°C), but if the heat in your grill fluctuates, or, say, you’re battling the elements, use your eyes and nose as a guide. If the grains are tinged with color and have a rich smoky smell at 20 minutes, pull them. If they’re still pale after 30 minutes, give them another 10 minutes over the heat.
Remove the grains from the grill and let them cool and dry completely. At this point, they’re ready to be prepared as you normally would — no need to adjust the usual cooking methods. In the meantime, store in a cool, dry place in an airtight container for up to 2 months.",9,11

Good food, and sharing it with those I love, has always been my great joy, too. So there was no question. The Jewish New Year was coming up, and not only would we be celebrating, but we would also be having Red’s brisket. 

The recipe, like many of the best ones, is fairly simple, but it’s time-consuming. While we sizzled onions and browned the meat, we played Bruce Springsteen and Burning Spear on the record player and broke out a bottle of red wine. As the house filled up with the scent of onions, stock, and garlic, I asked more probing questions about Red. Was living and eating large his way of compensating for a Depression-era childhood, sometimes only having bread with mustard to eat? Or the 13 months he spent in a German Prisoner of War camp during WWII, leaving him haunted and 50 pounds lighter when he was finally freed? My dad didn’t have the answers. But he assured me: Although Red wasn’t the greatest parent or partner, he would have spoiled his only granddaughter. 

Our Rosh Hashanah dinner wasn’t the type of blowout Red himself might have thrown, with a full house and copious amounts of booze, but the brisket sure tasted good.

4 cloves garlic
2 large carrots
1 brisket, preferably first or flat cut, 3 1/2 to 4-pound
1 teaspoon kosher salt, divided
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
3 cups chicken broth or stock
2 tablespoons tomato paste
1 tablespoon paprika
½ teaspoon ground white pepper","Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to 375°F. Meanwhile, cut 4 medium yellow onions into thick slices or large chunks, coarsely chop 4 cloves garlic, and peel and slice 2 large carrots crosswise into 2-inch pieces.
Season 1 (3 1/2 to 4-pound) brisket with 1/2 teaspoon of the kosher salt. Sprinkle all over with 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour and gently rub it onto the brisket to evenly coat.
Heat 3 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large oven-safe pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering. (Cut the brisket into half if needed to fit into the pot.) Add the brisket in batches if needed and sear until lightly browned on both sides, 5 to 10 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate.
Add the onions to the pot and cook until beginning to soften, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom, about 5 minutes. Add 3 cups chicken stock.
Return the brisket to the pot fat-side down and pour in any accumulated juices from the plate. Spread 2 tablespoons tomato paste evenly onto the brisket. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon paprika, 1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper, and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt. Add the garlic and carrots. Cover and bake for 1 1/2 hours.
Reduce the oven temperature to 325°F. Remove the pot from the oven and uncover. Transfer the brisket to a clean cutting board. Cut the brisket across the grain into 1/8 to-1/4-inch thick slices. Return the slices to the pot (basically reassembling the brisket). Don’t skip this step: the juices get between the slices of brisket as it continues to cook, making it fork tender and not dry or chewy.
Cover and bake for 1 1/2 hours more. Uncover and let the brisket cool to room temperature. Cover and refrigerate overnight or up to 2 days.
When ready to serve, scrape off and discard the hardened fat from the surface. Cover and reheat in a 350°F oven for 45 minutes before serving.",11,8
Ridiculously Good Air Fryer Broccoli,This Air Fryer Broccoli is both tender and crisped at the same time. So easy and done it 10 minutes!

Then pour the water into the air fryer, so it falls below the grates and stays there during the cooking process. Just another way to achieve a very similar result (and save a dish).
Every air fryer is different both in capacity and in temps. You may want to do this in smaller batches depending on the size of the air fryer you’re using. I use this air fryer.
If the broccoli overlaps in the basket a bit at first, that’s okay – it’ll reduce in size to eventually make a single layer for the last few minutes of roasting.
If you’re doing that final roast at 375 and not getting enough crisping, go up to 390 or 400!
If you don’t have a basket air fryer, that’s fine! Just follow step 1 and then transfer to a baking sheet. I almost think of this as “marinating” the broccoli with some moisture. The broccoli will hold onto that moisture (even if it doesn’t absorb it completely) and it helps keep it tender while roasting.",False,False,0,,,54.0,3.8,0.4,4.5,1.2,1.8,1.9,255.3,0.0,"1 12-ounce bag broccoli florets, or, one head of broccoli cut into about 3 cups of florets

Place florets in a bowl. Add water, oil, and salt. Break into bite-sized pieces and massage gently for 30-60 seconds, until the broccoli turns a slightly brighter green. You want to get it to drink up some of that water and oil mixture a bit!
Cook:
Add broccoli to your air fryer. (There will still be a bit of water left over in the bowl; that’s fine.) Air fry at 350 for 5 minutes; give it a quick shake. It should look bright green, like steamed broccoli.
Crisp it up:
Air fry at 375 for another 2 minutes. Now it should start to look browned, crisped, and roasty toasty. (You can adjust the time and temp to get your desired level of crispness).

If using chicken breasts, slice them in half if they’re thick, and bake at 400 degrees for 20 minutes. Cook chicken to 165 degrees.
Once you put the chicken in the air fryer (or on a sheet pan), if the surface looks like there’s not enough seasoning coverage, just sprinkle with a little bit more taco seasoning and oil to evenly coat the surface, or brush on some of the extra flavor paste from the bowl. Not necessary for flavor, but it’ll make it look nice and pretty for ya!
I usually cook mine in the air fryer for 11 minutes at 400 degrees – that seems to be the sweet spot for my air fryer, but each one will vary slightly. You want the chicken to be cooked to an internal temp of 165 degrees. Here’s my go-to meat thermometer that I use almost every time I make chicken to make sure I’m on the mark!
Every taco seasoning is different so you may need to experiment to find the best one for you! Many have a starchy element like cornstarch which helps create that crisped, golden exterior on the chicken. Some are sweeter, spicier, saltier, etc. I use the Siete taco seasoning (mild) almost every time, and it’s mild enough for my girls, and also delicious enough that me and my husband also really love it.

Cook the chicken:
Place the chicken in the basket of an air fryer (alternate cooking instructions in the notes). Air fry at 400 degrees for 10-12 minutes – at this point it should be very crusty, golden, juicy, and delicious.
Make the sauce:
While the chicken is cooking, blitz up the sauce in a small food processor or blender. If it’s too thick, add more water. If it’s too thin, add a bit more avocado or mayo.
Chop the chicken:
When the chicken is done, let it stand for a few minutes and then roughly chop or pull it into bite-sized pieces. Squeeze some lime juice over it. *chef’s kiss*

Rigatoni Alla Zozzona,"Rigatoni alla zozzona combines the ingredients of the four pasta dishes for which Romans are famous: amatriciana, cacio e pepe, carbonara and gricia. While many Italian meals are typically the result of simple flavors — “neat” preparations where only a few ingredients shine — rigatoni alla zozzona (which loosely translates to a big mess) is more of a kitchen sink approach, marrying the ingredients of the four pastas (tomato sauce, black pepper, egg yolks, cheese and guanciale) with sausage.

Delicious!Is this helpful? 303Anne3 years agoWe followed the recipe as is but when making it again would add more tomatoes. The sauce is very rich and would benefit, we think, from more acid from more tomatoes. I would also simply add canned diced tomatoes; the cherry tomatoes left their skins behind.Is this helpful? 297RME8 hours agoI made this as directed and would make it again way. The only change I made is now I cooked the rigatoni. You don't need to finally boil the pasta in gallons of water. A great many science-based food writers have pointed including Serious Eats, Alton Brown, and Harold McGee. Barely cover with cold salte water and simmer. It's easier to get uniformly cooked pasta, especially with rigatoni which can tear cooked the usual way, and you get super starchy water which is helpful for emulsificationIs this helpful?Pumpkin Spice6 days agoOkay so here’s the deal. It’s good. I read the comments prior to cooking and decided to use 28oz can of crushed tomatoes and an extra half cup of wine. All in all it came out tasty. However, for all the delicious ingredients throughout this dish it really seemed to lack depth and any complexity really. Perhaps my expectations were unrealistic, or perhaps it was user error :)Is this helpful?Charlie A. Pittsford, NY4 days agoFormer cook here: Try the tomato paste next time and you will find the flavor more intense. 28 oz of tomatoes and more wine carries too much liquid and dilutes the ingredients. Just a suggestion.Is this helpful? 1tom wallace1 week agoExcellent, but 1/2 pound Rigatoni was plenty.

2 tablespoons olive oil
½ teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed
¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more as needed
¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes
3 ounces sharp cheddar cheese, grated, about 3/4 cup
1 ounce Parmesan cheese, finely grated, about 1/2 firmly packed cup freshly grated or 1/3 cup store-bought
½ teaspoon Italian seasoning or dried oregano
8 ounces crusty sourdough bread
1 box low-sodium vegetable broth, 32-ounce
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar","Arrange 2 racks to divide the oven into thirds and heat the oven to 425°F.
Empty 1 can whole tomatoes and their juices into a large Dutch oven, then use your hands to gently break apart and crush the whole tomatoes. Prepare the following, adding them to the pot as you go: Halve and thinly slice 1 small yellow onion. Crush 4 garlic cloves. Cut 2 tablespoons of the unsalted butter into small pieces. Place 4 sprigs thyme on top. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil and season with 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, and 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes.
Roast on the lower rack uncovered, stirring halfway through, until the garlic is soft and the mixture is bubbling and noticeably thickened, 40 to 45 minutes total. Meanwhile, grate grate 3 ounces sharp cheddar cheese (about 3/4 cup) and finely grate 1 ounce Parmesan cheese (about 1/2 cup).
Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons unsalted butter in a large bowl. Add 1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning and stir to combine. Tear 8 ounces sourdough bread into rough 1-inch pieces directly into the bowl (about 4 cups). Use your hands to toss and coat the bread in the butter. Transfer to a baking sheet and spread into an even layer. Bake on the upper oven rack, tossing halfway through, until crisp and golden-brown at the edges, 13 to 15 minutes total.
When the tomatoes are ready, place the pot over medium heat. Stir the mixture to bring the thyme sprigs to the surface (be careful because the pot is hot), then discard the sprigs. Add 1 box low-sodium vegetable broth and simmer, stirring occasionally and scraping up the brown bits on the bottom and sides of the pot, until the flavors have melded, about 10 minutes.
Stir in 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar. Purée the soup in batches in a stand blender or with an immersion blender directly in the pot until smooth. Taste and season with more salt and pepper as needed.
If needed, move the upper rack to the middle of the oven so the Dutch oven fits under the broiler. Heat the broiler to HIGH. Sprinkle half the cheddar cheese over the soup. Top with the croutons, arranging them in a single layer so they cover the soup. Sprinkle with the remaining cheddar and all of the Parmesan. Broil on the upper oven rack until the cheese is melted, 1 to 2 minutes. Garnish with fresh thyme leaves.",15,7

-The recipe is a worthy candidate for conversion following the stone soup principle. Welcome additions to the basic stone include stock of any kind other than fish, ham, bacon, sausage of various kinds, and a grated hard cheese of your choice, each item singly or in combination.
-In any event, your predilection for purity should not last past your initial iteration of the soup. You will pull from the shelves seasonings, root vegetables, celery and onion, other species of green herb, a dose of cayenne or hot sauce, a grind of pepper and splash of Worcestershire.

Pour an additional 2 tablespoons of olive oil over dough and gently spread across. Gently stretch the dough to the edge of the sheet by placing your hands underneath and pulling outward. The dough will shrink a bit, so repeat stretching once or twice over the course of 30 minutes to ensure dough remains stretched.
Dimple the dough by pressing the pads of your first three fingers in at an angle. Make the brine by stirring together salt and water until salt is dissolved. Pour the brine over the dough to fill dimples. Set the focaccia aside to rise for 45 minutes until the dough is light and bubbly.

Using a chef’s knife, roughly chop the chicken into 1/2- to 1/4-inch chunks. Transfer to a medium bowl, add the remaining marinade, cover loosely with plastic, and refrigerate while you cook the rice and prepare the sauce.
For the rice:
Melt the butter over medium heat in a large Dutch oven. Add the turmeric and cumin and cook until fragrant but not browned, about 1 minute. Add the rice and stir to coat. Cook, stirring frequently, until the rice is lightly toasted, about 4 minutes. Add the chicken broth. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Raise the heat to high and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce to a simmer, and cook for 15 minutes without disturbing. Remove from the heat and allow to rest until the water is completely absorbed and the rice is tender, about 15 minutes.
For the sauce:
In a small bowl, combine the mayonnaise, yogurt, sugar, vinegar, lemon juice, parsley, and 2 teaspoons black pepper. Whisk to combine. Season to taste with salt.
To serve:
Return the entire contents of the chicken bowl (chicken, marinade, and all juices) to the skillet. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until heated through. To serve, divide the rice, lettuce, tomato, and toasted pita bread evenly among four to six plates. Pile the chicken on top of the rice. Top with the white sauce and hot sauce. Serve immediately, passing extra sauce at the table.",25,10

12 ounces beef flank steak, sliced against the grain into ¼-inch/6mm slices
1 tablespoon water
2 teaspoons cornstarch
2 teaspoons Shaoxing wine
1 teaspoon sesame oil
1 teaspoon oyster sauce
0.25 teaspoon baking soda
For the sauce:
0.66 cup hot water
3 tablespoons brown sugar, light or dark
2.5 tablespoons light soy sauce
1 tablespoon oyster sauce
1.5 teaspoons sesame oil
0.5 teaspoon rice vinegar
1 pinch white pepper
For the rest of the dish:
0.25 cup cornstarch
2.5 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds
0.5 cup neutral oil, such as canola or vegetable oil
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1 tablespoon scallions, chopped
2 teaspoons cornstarch, mixed into a slurry with 1 tablespoon water","Marinate the beef:
Combine the sliced beef with the water, cornstarch, Shaoxing wine, sesame oil, oyster sauce, and baking soda. Stir well, and set aside to marinate for 1 hour. You can also do this the night before. (For convenience—it doesn’t make a significant difference in flavor.)
Prepare the sauce:
In a medium bowl or measuring cup with a pour spout, stir together the hot water, light brown sugar, light soy sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil, rice vinegar, and white pepper. Set aside.
Dredge and sear the beef:
In a shallow dish, stir together the cornstarch and sesame seeds. Dredge the beef slices in this mixture until thoroughly coated. Give each slice a gentle shake to release excess cornstarch (grab a few at a time to expedite the process).
Heat the neutral oil in the wok or pan over medium-high heat. When a piece of beef sizzles in the oil (just before the oil begins to smoke), it’s ready for frying. Place the beef slices in the wok/pan in an even layer. Shallow-fry for 1 minute on each side to achieve a crusty coating, and transfer to a plate or sheet pan in one layer. Don’t pile the pieces on top of each other; you want the beef to stay crispy.
Finish the dish:
Let the particles in the oil settle, then drain the oil into a heat-proof bowl, leaving behind any sediment. Wipe the wok/pan clean with a paper towel. Add a tablespoon of oil back to the wok over medium heat, and add the chopped garlic. Cook for 15 seconds.
Then add the sauce mixture. Stir the sauce to deglaze the pan and bring it up to a simmer. Then add the scallions.
Add the cornstarch slurry mixture, and stir until the sauce thickens just enough to coat a spoon. You can also add a teaspoon or two of hot water to thin out the sauce if it looks too thick for your liking. Add the beef, and toss until the pieces are coated in sauce. Transfer to a plate and serve with lots of rice!",20,11

1 Toppings You Might Like
0.5 onion, diced or sliced, sautéed for an extra level up
4 lettuce leaves
1 tomato
12 pickle slices","Mix the smash burger sauce in a small bowl. In a larger bowl, place the ground beef and pour the sauce over. Mix with your hands to get it well-distributed through the meat. Form into 4 balls. Place the balls in the fridge for 20-30 minutes while you prep everything else. You can even pop it in the freezer for a few minutes – you just want them to be pretty cold so the butter mixture doesn’t immediately melt out everywhere once you start cooking them.
Butter the buns and toast them on your skillet or griddle until golden.
Prep the toppings and house sauce (see notes).
Cut a small piece of parchment paper that you’ll use on top of the burgers to prevent sticking.
Heat a cast iron skillet or flat griddle until it’s very hot; place a few of the burgers on the hot surface. Sprinkle them with a big pinch of salt and let them sit and sizzle for about 20 seconds.
Place the parchment paper on top of each burger and then, using a heavy, flat tool, press the burgers down as flat as you can get them in one swift motion. They’ll be super sizzly and splattery, but they should make a nice, round, thin smash burger shape on the griddle. (The ideal tool for this is a cast iron grill press, but a flat spatula can work in a pinch). Cook for a few minutes and then flip and top with cheese right away. Leave them undisturbed for another 1-2 minutes to melt the cheese and get a max amount of flavorful browning on the back side.
Assemble your burgers! Mine is always a toasted brioche buns, mega flavorful smash burger patty (or 2), cheese, crispy lettuce, and a thick smear of that house sauce. Happy, happy summer.",15,7

1 ½ cups whole milk, + 1/4 cup – see notes
1 cup flour
3 tablespoons melted butter
1 tablespoon granulated sugar
½ teaspoon salt
For topping:
1 lingonberry or blueberry jam
1 plain yogurt
1 whipped cream, or just straight heavy whipping cream – trust, it’s delicious","Make pancake batter:
Blend the eggs and milk until doubled in size, about 30 seconds. Add flour, melted butter, sugar, and salt; blend for another 15-20 seconds until combined.
Pour and pan tilt:
Preheat a nonstick or well seasoned cast iron pan over medium heat. Pour about 1/4 cup of pancake batter into the pan with one hand, and immediately tilt the pan with the other hand to spread the batter even wider. This will give you a signature thin lacy edge on your pancake.
Cook:
Let it sit for about 1 minute or until the pancake is golden brown; use a spatula to pull the edges up and flip the pancake. Cook for another 15-30 seconds on the back side. You can cook to your desired level of doneness; I prefer golden brown on the front side and pale on the back side.
Serve:
Serve them flat, folded, or rolled, topped with whatever you like: maple syrup, whipped cream, fruit, jams, etc. I like to fold them and serve with lingonberry jam and yogurt!",9,8

Sweet and Sour Eggplant With Garlic Chips,"This vibrant eggplant dish relies heavily on simple pantry staples, but gets its complex flavor from the clever use of garlic: First, you make garlic chips, then you fry eggplant in the remaining garlic-infused oil. Since garlic chips can burn easily, the key here is to combine the garlic and oil in an unheated pan for even cooking. As the oil heats up, the garlic will sizzle rapidly as the moisture cooks off. When it slows down, the garlic slices should be crisp. Be sure to remove the chips just as they begin to turn golden, as they will continue to cook after being removed from the oil. The rest is easy: Sauté the eggplant, create a quick soy sauce glaze, sprinkle with herbs and garlic chips, and serve.",4 servings,https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020459-sweet-and-sour-eggplant-with-garlic-chips,https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020459-sweet-and-sour-eggplant-with-garlic-chips?algo=combo_cooking_rec4u_bert_unique_60_specialdiets_20_top_conv_save_decay_30day_0.8_click&campaign_id=333&emc=edit_ckfy_20251014&fellback=false&imp_id=1939763781831395&instance_id=164417&nl=your-recipe-recommendations&pool=cooking-rec4u-ls&regi_id=100587641&req_id=1907473523737062&segment_id=207890&surface=cooking-email-rec4u&user_id=7cde6293cffa46b798d7160c14dc5491&variant=0_bert_unique_save_decay_30day_0.8_,,,,,"The information shown is Edamam’s estimate based on available ingredients and preparation.

2 eggs
1 tsp vanilla
½ cup all purpose flour, plus ½ cup for dredging
½ tsp baking powder
¼ cup sugar
¼ tsp salt
½ cup dried cherries, or raisins, optional
8 tbsp avocado oil, also use vegetable oil or any light oil, for frying","Dried fruit tip:
In a small bowl, soak the dried cherries or raisins in hot water to soften, while you make the dough. Skip if not using any dried fruit. I like to do half the batter with dried fruit and half without.
Make the syrniki batter:
Whisk 2 eggs in a large bowl and add the farmer's cheese and vanilla. Sift in ½ cup flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt, mix until combined with a fork. The batter will be thick like dough, not like traditional pancake batter. Divide dough in half and add dried fruit if you'd like to use fruit, or add fruit into the full recipe.
Form the syrniki:
Prepare a plate with ½ cup of flour – you will use it to coat the pancakes. Using a cookie scoop, scoop the batter into the flour. Gently roll around with your hands. Add the dough into your hands, gently press the pancakes to form a patty shape. Dust off any remaining flour, you only need a light coating.
Tip:
Before you start frying your syrniki make sure the oil in the frying pan is hot by sprinkling a bit of flour into it. If it sizzles it’s hot enough.
Cook the syrniki:
Using a large nonstick skillet, heat 3-4 tablespoons of oil, and gently place the flour-dredged cheese pancakes into the pan. Cook on medium heat for about 3-4 minutes per side, or until each side is golden brown. Place on a paper towel to drain and cool.
Do not crowd the pan – cook them in 2-3 batches if necessary.
Serving options:
To serve, sprinkle with powdered sugar, or drizzle with maple syrup or honey. Try the traditional Russian way of topping with sour cream and fresh berries or preserves.",9,13

Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C) and roast the cashews (yes even if you bought them roasted, roast them again) on a baking sheet for 8-10 minutes, and until they darken in color. If starting with raw cashews, roast them for 10-12 minutes, stirring them half way through for more even roasting, until they are slightly darker than golden.
Combine the chicken thigh with soy sauce and mix well. If using chicken breast, add 1 ½ tablespoon of water in addition to the soy sauce. In either case let it sit for at least 15 minutes.
Combine all sauce ingredients in a small bowl.
If using dried chilies, add the oil to a wok and add the dried chilies; turn the heat on to low. Keep stirring the chilies until they puff and darken into a maroon colour, about 1 minute.

Crispy chicken skin for garnish, optional, see recipe here
Toasted rice powder:
3 Tbsp uncooked Thai sticky rice or jasmine rice
1 makrut lime leaf, aka kaffir lime leaf, optional","To make toasted rice powder:
In a dry saute pan, add the rice and the kaffir lime leaf and toast, stirring constantly, over high heat until the rice has a deep brown colour. Remove from heat immediately and transfer into a mortar and pestle or a coffee grinder.
Grind until fine (yes, grind the lime leaf too), but if using a coffee grinder, be careful not to over-grind—you don't want it to look like flour, you still want a bit of grittiness to it.
To make the laab:
In a wide pot or saute pan, add the water or stock and bring to a simmer. Add ground chicken and 1 teaspoon of the fish sauce, then cook, stirring constantly to break up any big lumps, just until it is done.
Remove from heat, then, using the pot as your salad bowl, add the shallots and stir to wilt slightly and to make sure all the shallot layers are separated.
Then add fish sauce, lime juice, chili flakes, and 2 tablespoon of the toasted rice powder; stir to mix well. Then add green onions and sawtooth coriander and/or cilantro and stir to mix. Tip: If you're not serving right away, hold the toasted rice powder and stir it in just before serving, otherwise the toasted rice powder will absorb all the dressing and make the salad seem dry, and the toasted rice powder will become slightly mushy.
Taste and adjust seasoning, if the acidity is a bit too intense you can add ½-1 teaspoon sugar or a little more rice powder to help balance the acidity.
Plate and sprinkle the mint on top. Garnish with a couple of dried chilies if you want, and sprinkle with some crispy chicken skin, if using (here's my crispy chicken skin in minutes recipe!).

roasted chili flakes, to taste
Sauce:
1 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoons Golden Mountain Sauce, or sub more soy sauce
2 teaspoons fish sauce
2 tablespoons brown sugar, packed, dark is preferred but light is fine
1 ½ tablespoons black soy sauce, , see note 3
2 tablespoons sriracha-style hot sauce","Make garlic oil and fried garlic.:
In a small pot, add the oil and turn the heat on to medium low. Add a piece of garlic as a tester, then once the test garlic is bubbling, add the remaining garlic.
Fry garlic in oil until golden, stirring frequently, being careful not to let it turn brown. Strain, keeping the oil and garlic separate and set aside. This can be done far ahead of time.
Cook the ground pork.:
In a small or medium pot, add 1-2 tablespoons of water just to coat the bottom and put it on medium-high heat. Once the water is bubbling, add the ground pork and stir, breaking up the lumps, until fully cooked. Transfer to a bowl and set aside and keep covered so it stays warm; there will be lots of pooling liquid, this is fine.
Make the sauce.:
In a small bowl, combine all the sauce ingredients, and then take about 1 tablespoon of the juice from the ground pork and add it to the sauce as well - this added liquid will help the sugar dissolve. Stir until the sugar is dissolved.
When ready to cook and serve:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil (6-qt pot minimum). Meanwhile, cut the noodles down with scissors so they’re not too long; this will help make it easier to toss and serve. Loosen the noodles to ensure no strands are stuck together.
Heat the sauce up either in the microwave or in a pot on the stove, just until it's hot/warm so that it won’t cool down the noodles too much. Don’t let the sauce reduce. Keep covered until ready to use.
If your ground pork is no longer warm, you can heat it up in the microwave or stovetop as well.
Once the water is boiling, add the meatballs and boil them for about a minute or 2 until they are hot. Scoop them out and set aside.
Once the water comes back to boil, add the bean sprouts and blanch them for literally 3 seconds just to warm them up, then scoop them up and place in a large mixing bowl.
Wait for the water to come back to a boil, then cook the noodles for 2-3 minutes, if using wonton noodles, or however long your particular noodles take to cook. Scoop them out with a wire skimmer, shake off all excess water and place them into the mixing bowl with the bean sprouts.
Pour the garlic oil over the noodles and toss to separate the noodles and mix them with the beansprouts. Then add the ground pork, holding back any pooling liquid in the bowl. Add the peanuts, chili flakes, the sauce, and chopped green onions and toss to mix well.
Divide into serving bowls and top each bowl with the meatballs, chopped cilantro, fried garlic, and a lime wedge. Be sure to squeeze the lime over the noodles before eating, and feel free to add more chili flakes or sriracha as desired. Enjoy!",17,16

Add panko and mix with the shallots in the pan; sauté another couple of minutes until the whole mixture is golden. Transfer to a small bowl. Toss with the herbs and a pinch of salt.
Start the curry:
Wipe the pan out. Turn the heat back on to medium. Add the oil, curry paste, garlic, ginger, and veggies; let it cook for a few minutes. Add coconut milk; simmer until the sauce has thickened slightly and veggies are starting to get tender, about 5 minutes.
Add shrimp:
Place the shrimp on top of the gently bubbling curry. The shrimp will basically just steam / poach in the liquid! Easy. After 2-3 minutes, flip the shrimp so they can finish cooking on the other side. When they’re done they’ll start to curl and be fully opaque – in this picture they’re about half done.
Season:
Stir in the fish sauce and brown sugar. Taste and adjust – make it more spicy with chili crisp, more salty with fish sauce, etc.
You’re Done! Yum. Scoop the curry over some rice, and top with a little sprinkle of the shallot crispies (OMG).",15,8

Grilling: Preheat grill to medium high heat and lightly oil the grates. Remove the chicken from the marinade, letting the excess drip off. Grill chicken for 5 to 6 minutes on each side or until cooked through. Chicken needs to reach an internal temperature of 165°F. Baste the chicken occasionally with the reserved marinade.

⅓ cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving, 80 ml
¼ cup chopped fresh parsley leaves
1 Kosher salt","Directions:
If Using a Grill (recommended): Preheat a gas or charcoal grill to medium heat and place eggplants directly over heat source. Cook, turning occasionally with tongs, until eggplants are completely tender and well charred on all sides, 30 to 40 minutes. Wrap with foil and let rest 15 minutes. Continue to step 3.
Open foil package. Working with one eggplant at a time, use a sharp paring knife to slit each eggplant open lengthwise. Carefully scoop out soft flesh with a large spoon and transfer to a fine-mesh strainer set in a large bowl. Once all eggplant is scooped, pick out any stray bits of skin and blackened flesh and discard.
Transfer eggplant to a salad spinner, distributing it evenly around the perimeter. Spin gently until all excess moisture is extracted. Discard all drippings, wipe out large bowl, and return eggplant to bowl.
Add lemon juice and garlic to eggplant and stir vigorously with a fork until eggplant breaks down into a rough paste, about 1 1/2 minutes. Stirring constantly and vigorously, add tahini, followed by the olive oil in a thin, steady stream. The mixture should become pale and creamy. Stir in parsley and season to taste with salt, plus more lemon juice if desired.
Transfer to a serving bowl, drizzle with olive oil, and serve with warm pita bread or vegetables for dipping.
If using the broiler:
Adjust rack to 6 inches below broiler element and preheat broiler to high. Place eggplants on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet and prick all over with a fork. Broil, turning occasionally, until charred on all sides and completely tender, about 30 minutes (timing may vary depending on broiler strength). Eggplants should be very, very tender when cooked; if eggplant is not fully tender once skin is charred all over, switch oven to 425°F and roast until fully tender (a toothpick or skewer inserted near stem and bottom ends should not meet any resistance). Remove from oven and gather up foil, crimping it around eggplants to form a sealed package. Let eggplants rest for 15 minutes. Continue to step 3.",7,8

Let them cool on the pan for a good 30 minutes or so (I mean, okay, eat four or five but then let the rest of them cool).

Trim the core, then thinly slice the cabbage about the same width as the onion (about 8 cups). Peel 1 large carrot, then cut crosswise into 2-inch pieces. Cut the pieces lengthwise into 1/8-inch thick planks. Stacking a few planks at a time, very thinly slice lengthwise into matchsticks. (If using pre-shredded carrots, add 1 1/2 cups directly to the bowl.) Coarsely chop the leaves and tender stems from 1/2 bunch fresh cilantro sprigs until you have 1/4 cup.
When the chicken is ready, transfer to a clean cutting board and let cool. When the onions are ready, drain off the vinegar. Meanwhile, make the dressing.
Mince 1 garlic clove and place in a small bowl. Juice 1 to 2 medium limes into the bowl until you have about 2 1/2 tablespoons. Add 1/3 cup rice vinegar, 2 tablespoons fish sauce, and 2 tablespoons granulated sugar, and whisk to combine.
Shred the chicken into bite-sized pieces. Add the chicken and onions to the vegetables and toss with your hands to combine. Drizzle with the dressing and toss to combine. Let sit for 5 to 10 minutes for the flavors to meld. Taste and season with more lime juice as needed. Sprinkle each serving with 1 to 2 tablespoons fried shallots and serve with prawn chips if desired.",14,6
Three-Cup Chicken,"Ask 30 people how to make this simple Taiwanese recipe, and you’ll receive 30 different responses. Some fry the chicken before braising it, use more oil, less wine, different blends of soy sauce. Debates rage over how thick the sauce should be, over which parts of the chicken to use. (Few follow the folk recipe that calls for making the sauce with a cup each of sesame oil, soy sauce and rice wine. “If you actually cook it that way,” says Eddie Huang, the Taiwanese-American chef who inspired the television program “Fresh Off the Boat,” “you’ll be in trouble.”) Our reporting and testing led us to the recipe below.

I brought it to a Lunar New Year party and some Taiwanese guests tried it and then bogarted the whole pot because they said it was authentic and delicious. The key is dark meat, they said.

Preheat the oven to 350°F. Put the tofu on a large rimmed baking sheet and coat it on both sides with the oil and tamari. Bake for 15 minutes, then flip the slices and bake for 15 minutes more.
Make the rib sauce:
While the tofu is in the oven, in a 2-cup measuring cup, use a fork to vigorously whisk the cornstarch into the vegetable broth until it’s mostly dissolved. Add the remaining ingredients and mix well.
Transfer the sauce to a small saucepot and heat over medium, stirring occasionally, until it comes to a boil. Once boiling, lower the heat to a low simmer and let the sauce thicken for about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.
Smother the cooked tofu with the rib sauce, return it to the oven, and bake for 15 minutes more. Remove the pan from the oven and tent it with aluminum foil to keep warm until ready to serve.
Make the root mash:
Put the parsnips and rutabaga in a 4-quart pot and submerge them in water by 2 inches. Cover the pot and bring the water to a boil over high heat.

Combine all the marinade ingredients in a bowl and stir to mix well. Pour the marinade into the bag with the tofu. Press out as much air as possible and seal the bag. Gently swirl the bag around so all the tofu is coated with the marinade. Set aside, occasionally flipping as you finish your prep.
Combine all the sauce ingredients in a medium-sized bowl. Stir until the cornstarch is dissolved.
Cut the florets off the stalks of broccoli. If there is excess stem, peel it and cut it into 1/2” (1 cm) sticks. Wash them, drain them, and set them aside.
Drain the marinated tofu and discard the marinade. Add half of the cornstarch into the bag, shake to coat well. Then add the rest to coat the tofu pieces. It’s OK if the tofu pieces are not covered evenly.
Heat 1” (2.5 cm) of water in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until boiling. Add the broccoli. Blanch broccoli to the tenderness you prefer, 2 minutes for a chewy texture or 3 minutes for a softer one. Drain thoroughly and discard the water, transfer the broccoli to a large plate.

1 Vegetable oil, for oiling the grill","If using wooden skewers, place 6 in water and let soak while you prepare the tsukune.
Place 1 1/4 cups soy sauce, 3/4 cup mirin, 1/2 cup sake, and 2 tablespoons packed brown sugar in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, stirring constantly, until the sugar is dissolved. Continue to simmer, stirring frequently, until reduced by half (about 1 1/4 cups), syrupy, and thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, 10 to 12 minutes.
Line a rimmed baking sheet or plate with aluminum foil.
Prepare the following, adding each to the same large bowl as it is completed: Finely chop 2 to 4 medium scallions until you have 1/3 cup. Peel and finely grate 3 large garlic cloves (about 2 teaspoons). Peel and finely grate a 1/2-inch piece of ginger until you have 3/4 teaspoon.
Add 1 pound ground chicken, 1 large egg, 1/3 cup panko breadcrumbs, 1/2 teaspoon toasted sesame oil, 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, and 1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper. Vigorously stir with a wooden spoon or flexible spatula until light, airy and paste-like in texture, 2 to 3 minutes.
With damp hands, shape and roll the mixture into 18 (1-inch) meatballs. Place on the foil, arranging them in rows of 3. Insert a skewer through each row of meatballs, skewering through the center of each and leaving a little space between each one.
Refrigerate for 15 minutes to let the meatballs firm up and the breadcrumbs rehydrate. Meanwhile, heat an outdoor grill to medium-high, direct heat (about 425ºF). If you’re using a grill pan on the stovetop, wait until the meatballs are chilled before heating to medium-high heat.
Scrape the grill grates clean if needed. Oil the grill grate with a paper towel dipped in vegetable oil. Lightly coat the tops of the meatballs with cooking spray. Place the skewers with the meatballs oil-side down on the grill grates. Cover and grill undisturbed until browned on the bottom and they easily release off the grill grates, 3 to 4 minutes. Meanwhile, discard the foil.
Flip the skewers and continue grilling, turning them every few minutes, until well browned all over, cooked through, and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a meatball registers at least 165ºF, 6 to 7 minutes more.
Brush the meatballs with a thin layer of the sauce (save the remaining sauce for grilled fish, yakitori, or more tsukune). Grill uncovered for 15 to 20 seconds more.

Chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley and sour cream for serving","Make the dough:
Bring water and butter to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium. Meanwhile, stir together flour and salt in a large bowl; make a well in center, and add egg. While stirring constantly with a fork, slowly pour hot water mixture into well, incorporating flour mixture into egg mixture until shaggy pieces of dough form.
Transfer mixture to a lightly floured work surface along with any remaining flour in bowl. Knead, pressing any loose flour into dough, until smooth and soft, 3 to 5 minutes. If dough is too sticky, lightly sprinkle with additional flour. (Do not overwork dough.) Shape dough into a ball, and cover using plastic wrap; let rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes or up to 1 hour.
Meanwhile, make the filling:
Place cottage cheese in a fine mesh strainer placed over a medium bowl, and let drain until ready to use; discard drained liquid. Place potato in a large pot and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon salt. Add enough water to cover by 1 inch. Bring to a boil over high; reduce heat to medium, and gently boil, uncovered and undisturbed, until potato is tender, about 8 minutes. Drain well; transfer to a medium bowl. Reserve the pot.
While potato cooks, melt 2 tablespoons butter in a medium skillet over medium. Add onion, pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon salt; cook, stirring often, until softened and lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from heat.
Using a potato masher, mash hot potato until smooth. Stir in drained cottage cheese, sautéed onion, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt. Refrigerate, uncovered, until cooled, about 20 minutes.
Fill the large pot with generously salted water and bring to a boil over high. While water comes to a boil, transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface. Roll into a 1/16- to 1/8-inch-thick round (about 16 inches in diameter). Using a 3 1/2-inch-round cookie cutter, cut dough into rounds; reroll dough scraps once (20 to 22 rounds total). Working with 1 dough round at a time, place 1 rounded tablespoon filling in center. Moisten dough edges with water. Fold round in half to form a half-moon that pockets the filling; press edges together firmly to seal, pressing out any air, and pleating as desired. Place on a large baking sheet lined using parchment paper; cover using a clean kitchen towel. Repeat process with remaining dough rounds and filling.
Add half of dumplings to boiling water, and gently stir once. Cook, undisturbed, until dumplings float, 2 to 3 minutes; continue cooking for 1 minute. Using a slotted spoon, transfer dumplings to a large heatproof bowl with remaining 2 tablespoons butter; toss until coated in melted butter. Repeat cooking process with remaining dumplings. Divide dumplings evenly among 4 bowls, garnish with parsley, and serve immediately with sour cream, if desired.",15,9
